913,49,9/24/2021 10:51, thats both funny and i guess imaginative. leave it to a huge tech company to employ actual goats!, i have heard Serena williams is a co-owner of the miami dolphins
873,50,10/6/2021 17:34, Yeah exactly I am sure they are cheaper. One thing I bet they couldn't exploit is fish. I think fish are so cool there is actually a breed of jellyfish that is immortal.," I didn't know that, she speaks french and italian so I wonder if she owns any sports teams in Europe"
413,51,9/19/2021 20:04, i had rememered hearing about that before. Immortatlity is wasted on a jellyfish haha. did you know a seahorse is the only fish that has an actual neck?," not sure but In january 2007, serena williams was ranked 95th in the world in tennis"
217,52,8/23/2021 12:09, That is so funny I guess I never considered a seahorse a fish. The black swallower fish sounds a lot like a snake because it can eat pray that is so large., I never knew she was ever ranked that low
4,53,9/29/2021 2:19, i guess they live up to their name then!," well she reached the No. 1 ranking for the first time on July 8, 2002 but has since fallen"

1,56,8/26/2021 20:39, Yeah and saltwater fish are lucky because they can do that and drink through their mouth's.," I don't know, maybe"
809,57,10/2/2021 14:39, seems like fresh water fish got the short end of the stick with that one. Have you ever been to a cat cafe?," Have you heard of the new ""First Man"" film starring Ryan Gosling?"
389,58,9/25/2021 1:20," I have never been to a cat cafe no, what about you? Seems like they are popular in Japan and Taiwan."," No, I have not.  Please tell me about it."
820,59,9/25/2021 7:06, no but I would love to! paying hourly to hang out with adorable cats? im in!, It's a space movie.  He plays the character of Neil Armstrong.  It was released Friday.
1101,60,8/24/2021 23:20, Yeah that would be a lot of fun. I didn't realize that cats sleep so much. Must be nice., Did you watch the movie?  Was it really a space movie?
1358,61,9/10/2021 0:21," i guess thats where the phrase ""cat nap"" comes from", I haven't seen it yet.  Today was the first time I heard of it.
1290,62,9/20/2021 10:35, Oh yeah I guess so ha ha. There's even a town in Alaska that has a mayor cat., It is hard to talk about this movie if we both have not seen it.  Can we change the topic?
412,63,9/24/2021 11:53, Hi!  do you like to dance?, Let's talk about Earth.  It's the third planet from the sun.  
479,64,9/29/2021 6:00, I love to dance a lot. How about you?," Apparently, 80 percent of the earth's natural forests have already been destroyed.  It's depressing to me."
675,65,9/14/2021 9:03," I am really bad, but it is a good time.", That is sad for sure.  Sad that people are the cause of it too.
1220,66,9/5/2021 20:28, Dancing is a lot of fun. Did you know that Bruce Lee was a great dancer?," When the earth was first formed, there was only 5.5 hours long in a day.  "
337,67,8/30/2021 4:14," I heard that, winning Cha Cha championships and everything!", Wow.  I didn't know that.  71 percent of the earth's surface is covered by water.  I wonder what covers the polar regions?
240,68,10/13/2021 7:01, Yes that is amazing. He won the Hong Kong cha-cha championship back in 1958 in fact.," Ice?  I am not sure though.  Apparently, earth will be helium free by the end of the 21st century."
1065,69,9/26/2021 12:52, I always just thought of him as a martial arts legend.  Now he is a dance legend of sorts too!, Yes.  Ice is right.  It's almost like the history of the earth is like watching a science fiction movie only in real life.
605,70,10/10/2021 21:45, Yeah!! That is correct. He was a fantastic martial artist. Did you know that Tupac danced ballet in high school?," I like science fiction.  I like to imagine things, like aliens in a different planet."
574,71,10/9/2021 13:01," Yeah!  He was the mouse king in the Nutcracker.  Thats pretty cool, I would definitely never have guessed that about him.", Do you like Starship Troopers?  
57,72,9/29/2021 9:31, Neither did I. That is insane because Tupac was a famous rapper. ," Yes, because it is the only science fiction novel recommended by three branches of the military.  I wonder why they recommended it though - do you know?"
512,73,9/12/2021 10:58," He was indeed, his music is even in the library of congress.", I have no idea.  lol  The word robotics was made up by a book writer - Isaac Asimov.  Seems like robots and space are always a big theme for science fiction books and movies. 
244,74,8/25/2021 23:52, I didn't know this thanks for sharing.," By the way, do you know that the United Nations appointed an ambassador to greet extraterrestrials in case they want to say hello to us?"
499,75,9/24/2021 23:29, Sure thing!  Did you hear about Michael Jackson's special patent shoes?," That's interesting!  What a job to have!  That's just like something out of the movie Star Wars, which came out in 1977 and the value of that franchise is now $65 billion dollar! "
397,76,8/23/2021 2:06, No. I know that Michael Jackson was a fantastic dancer but can you tell me more about his patent shoes if you don't mind., Wow.  That is a lot of money.  I heard that it is currently the 5th largest grossing media franchise. 
1464,77,9/27/2021 14:24, There was a specific device in his shoes that helped with his extreme lean in some dance moves., Initially 20th century fox was convinced that Star Wars was going to be a flop.  Wow we're they wrong.
406,78,9/27/2021 19:42, Wow!!! That is amazing coming from such a talented singer and dancer. I couldn't even dance like that even if I dreamed of it., They were wrong indeed.  George Lucas got a better deal by forgoing $500k directing fee.
290,79,10/7/2021 4:04, Me neither. I could never be a professional dancer.," James Earl Jones only made $7,500 for 2 1/2 hours of work providing the voice for Darth Vader.  Thought he would have spent more time and made more money recording that voice."
644,80,8/31/2021 2:47, I heard that some professional ballet dancer can go through four pairs of shoes in a week., I do not think $7500 is a lot of money to provide Darth Vader's voice because the movie was very successful.  What do you think?
518,81,10/11/2021 14:56, That is crazy!  That can't be cheap for them., I wonder if the actors get any royalties from the movie?  
413,82,9/24/2021 15:55, No. I think its very expensive for them to be professional ballet dancers based on this., They should.  George Lucas should be generous since he got so much money from Star Wars.
155,83,9/27/2021 3:46," It has been great chatting but I must go!  Gotta go get my Bruce Lee on, the martial arts part...  definitely not the dance.", You would think!  He's a billionaire from the movie!
588,84,9/2/2021 10:27, Ha Ha!!! It was so nice chatting with you as well!! Have a nice day!!! Bye, Rich people are often cheap.
239,85,9/27/2021 7:08, Bye, That's sad...but so true.  I've seen it too much during my working lifetime where the people at the top get richer and the workers on the factory floor just barely have enough money to live on.
429,86,8/31/2021 20:15, do you like dance?," I wonder if someone was fired at fox because of George Lucas deal. Anyway, I've got to run.  Nice chatting with you."
435,87,9/19/2021 8:06, I love it. Did you know Bruce Lee was a dancer?, Dogs or cats?
1002,88,9/16/2021 4:43, Yes he even won a cha cha championship in 1958," Hi! I have two cats, but want a dog. You?"
254,89,10/10/2021 22:17, Yeah. Did you know ballet dancers use a lot of shoes?," I like dogs more, but dont mind cats! Google likes dogs more though"
1160,90,9/14/2021 6:41, Yes they go through 4 pairs in a single week, Hah. I see their code of conduct state they are a DOG company. 
1110,91,9/4/2021 8:19, Yeah that is a lot of shoes and also a lot of money," lol, I heard you can bring you dog to work while working there, kind of discriminating against cats though!"
982,92,10/6/2021 4:50, Yeah. Babies are also really good at dancing when they hear music, Kinda odd since dogs are normally louder and more likely to poop somewhere. Looks like Istanbul even has vending machines to release food and water for strays.
1445,93,8/25/2021 17:44, Yes and they smile more when they hit the beat," that is a great point! The US needs to get those vending machines, I would donate so many plastic bottles. That is nice of that country"
540,94,8/30/2021 8:34, Yeah pretty cute. Did you know Tupac was a ballet dancer?, I wonder where else the dogs go if not for vencing machines?
744,95,9/18/2021 12:06, Yes he was in the nutcracker as the mouse king," right, they probably go for trash cans unfortunately. Did you know dogs have 12 types of blood?"
1252,96,9/28/2021 16:01, Yeah. DO you like SHakespeare?, Makes sense for variety. Apparently they have doggie blood drives too!
163,97,8/30/2021 16:52, I love his work. Did you know he popularized many terms that we use to this day?," that would be so awesome to volunteer at. I will have to look them up. Did you know dogs and elephants are the only animals that respond to pointing, sorry cats"
1434,98,8/24/2021 7:54," Yes terms like, good riddance, in my heart of heart and such"," My cats responding to pointing, and throwing."
765,99,9/17/2021 19:44, Yes. He lives at the same time as Pocahontas did," That is true, so I wonder if there are more we don't know about lol. Do you like horses at all?"
689,100,9/2/2021 2:58, I wonder if they had met what he would have written about her., I took a horse ride once and live in an area with lots of horses. They are beautiful animals. you?
602,101,10/10/2021 9:55, Yeah good point. He also invented some women's names," They are so beautiful, I like petting them but never rode one. I wouldn't ride Icelandic horses because they are super fast."
1004,102,10/2/2021 5:42," Yes among those are Olivia, Miranda and Jessica", I wonder if riders trained horses to do that?
980,103,10/8/2021 5:38, Yeah. Did you know that his works have to stick to the old english language to make sense?, I am sure they did. I just wouldn't ride horses to school on no vehicle day and get suspended like two students did. I feel that was pointless
1289,104,9/27/2021 12:14," Yes especially with punk and rhymes, they do not work with modern language", That's funny and rather stupid at the same time.
1350,105,8/23/2021 15:42, Yeah. Did you know Tchaikozsky donated his skull in hopes it will be used in Shakespeare's plays?," For sure lol, it was so nice talking with you, say hi to your cats for me!"
1210,106,10/9/2021 10:24, Yes and did get used so that is good. Nice chat," My cats will run away, but sure!"
10,107,9/2/2021 7:45," hi, do you use google much?", lol! bye now!
243,108,9/11/2021 21:54," Yes, I think it is the most effective search engine. How about you? Do you use gmail?", Crazy that early humans used to have to battle giant sloths! Who would've thought?
587,109,9/21/2021 8:17, Yes. a google search takes more computing power than sending astronauts tot he moon," I know right! Humans have been around for a long time apparently I mean we lost our body hair 240,000 years ago!"
1289,110,9/21/2021 4:10, And before on Google moon they used to use cheese for close ups!," Yea that's really interesting. I never knew humans could regrow a rib bone that has been surgically shortened, either."
494,111,8/29/2021 11:39, do you know how google maps calculates traffic?, No I didn't know that either. I wonder if other animals can do that? Like can we Harvest Pig ribs for food and then they will regrow that way we don't have to kill the pig haha
150,112,10/13/2021 4:37," I am not sure, how do they do this?", That would be awesome! I'm sure science will figure that out someday! We can already use our current technology to date the extinction of ground sloths and determine where ancient human footprints led to.
692,113,9/8/2021 3:04, they track how fast android devices are moving, That's really cool. I would love to see that. They should put that in the movie! I think it's cool that humans are adapted for persistence running. We are some of the best animals in the world at it
1487,114,9/2/2021 0:44, Interesting! Google really is taking over the world. Their data center electricity use is 0.01 percent of all worldwide electricity., Haha yea that would be cool. That's really surprising humans are the best at persistence running! I wouldn't have guessed that. As long as those pesky hiccups don't attack while running! Darn evolution leftovers!
440,115,9/28/2021 18:58, Yes for sure they are. they have grown so much over the years," Haha yep hiccups are so annoying! So is that frequency that causes fear in humans ,have you heard about that LOL?"
610,116,9/4/2021 11:08, But I like that they like to have fun too. Have you ever typed askew into Google?," No, I had not. So fear comes from sound...? I thought it had to do with the autonomic nervous system, fight or flight thing? That would be really interesting to look into further. "
92,117,9/19/2021 14:29, No I have. What does the results turn?, Can come from sound. And yes I'm going to look into that further as well. Do you like any animals by the way?
1106,118,10/13/2021 2:38, You should try it! It tilts the page. Another fun thing Google does is call new employees nogglers. They have to wear propeller beanies. Or is this mean?," I used to own two cats, no current pets though. I would love to go to Japan and play with some cats at a cat cafe though! haha"
314,119,9/17/2021 10:17," Oh, not sure about that really. People say it is a great place to work at though", Haha that does seem like a great idea! Get a drink and pet a cat LOL. Did you know that a cat will spend 10 years of its life sleeping when it's only 15 years old LOL that's a long time
768,120,9/27/2021 18:39," Before Google launched gmail, that was the name of a free email service offered by garfield's website. That actually seems more fun."," That is nuts! What I wouldn't give to trade places! Or trade places with Stubbs, the cat who is the mayor of Talkeentna, Alaska! Sounds like a sweet gig."
835,121,9/4/2021 6:31, I know now everytime I open gmail I think of garfield, It does sound awesome! I don't know what kind of work she does but she must be doing a great job lol have you ever seen the movie The Godfather by the way
1014,122,10/4/2021 12:40," Speaking of cats, I would love to get a glow in the dark one. They have those in South Korea.", Right? Haha And yea I've seen the Godfather but it's been a while.
105,123,9/29/2021 22:32, Wow. In Japana and Taiwan there are cat cafes where you can play with them," Well in the opening scene the cat that they use, I don't know if you remember that part, but it was actually a stray apparently"
480,124,10/5/2021 8:43, That seems fun! That reminds me of the Anderson house bed and breakfast in Minnesota. They used to offer a free cat for the night when you booked a room.," Yea, I vaguely remember, that's awesome. Another sweet gig for a cat! Now if only I woulda thought to have one of my cats coauthor a book with me. I guess some physicist did so so that he could use the first person plural without being criticized!"
1435,125,8/24/2021 6:34, wow. there is a town in alaska where the mayor of the town is a cat, That is funny! What do you think about Scotland putting a lot in place to protect the Loch Ness monster? Do you think that means he might exist LOL
10,126,8/24/2021 21:14," That is cool. Cats are a pretty smart species. There has not been a cat species extinction in 10,000 years."," Haha that is strange. It definitely makes one wonder...maybe the loch ness is some super secret scientific experiment or military weapon? Haha I guess thanks to the Germans, who in 2002 were the first to give animals constitutionally guaranteed legal rights, Scotland can do what it wants concerning the Loch Ness!"
927,127,9/28/2021 4:43, They are indeed very smart and that proves it. Nice chatting with you., The Loch Ness monster should have legal rights to! Did you know that there are 20 quintillion individual animals on planet Earth. I have no idea how many zeros that is but I know it is a lot LOL
1251,128,10/12/2021 8:50, Do you like comic books?, Haha that is insane. How does anyone even figure out that there's that many animals?! Interesting that domesticated animals develop a white patch on their forehead. I wonder what that's about?
1124,129,9/23/2021 6:06, I do like comic books!," I know right. like will a fish get a patch of white on its forehead?the only animals that have that that I've ever seen our dogs, so I just don't know LOL"
1376,130,9/2/2021 22:36, Have you heard that Harley Quinn has a new comic book series coming out?," Hi, Do you like to cook?"
956,131,10/12/2021 20:33," I have not heard that.  I know that comic book legend Stan Lee used to end every phone conversation with ""excelsior!""", I love to cook. just not in july when it is so hot.
1221,132,9/23/2021 0:54, I've heard that too. Did you know that the DC in DC comics stands for Detective Comics?," Right, it's no fun when it is hot and you're trying to cook. We like to grill a lot outside, which helps not make our home more hot."
1077,133,9/13/2021 9:03, I just read that today.  The largest comic book market is in Japan.  I believe it.  My son loves to read those mangas., Grilling out is the best to help with the heat inside the house. If I have to cook in the house i do it early in the morning before it gets too hot.
691,134,8/31/2021 5:20, I would love to go there. I used to like reading Manga too. ," Yes that's another great idea. We also sometimes eat out if it is way too hot, or eating something like salads or cereal. Where we aren't using heat at all."
414,135,9/14/2021 6:42, The manga market is Japan is valued at $6 to $7 billion dollars!, That is a great idea. We tend to eat leftovers too and just use the micorwave.
853,136,9/10/2021 15:20, That is wild! Did you know that Michigan State University library has the largest publicly available comic book collection in the world?," The microwave is great and fast, I agree. Making Icecream is a great way to cool down when it gets too hot. We also tend to use box fans."
545,137,10/4/2021 5:10," I didn't know that.  I wonder how many people use it.  By comparison to Japan, the US comic book market in the US and Canada is $1.09 billion!", We use a fan for sure. Also started using like a slow cooker or toaster oven not as hot and now can fit up to a whole chicken.
249,138,9/2/2021 3:05," That's crazy, Japan is way more into comic books than America it seems. "," Great appliances help to cook! We love our air-fryer. Though it tends to eat up the area some, so we open the doors and dim the lights to help with the heat."
179,139,10/12/2021 5:50," I agree!  The Marvel cinematic universe takes place in earth -199999, a multiverse different from the original comic book multiverse, earth-616!", I heard some people turn their wrist upside down  to get their blood flowing to stay cool.
46,140,9/15/2021 17:25," That's pretty wild. Marvel published a ""generic comic book,"" in order to trademark the names ""superhero"" and ""super-villain."" That was pretty smart of them. "," Wow great information, I will have to try that sometime. Do you like to eat fish or even go fishing?"
169,141,9/22/2021 11:02, No doubt!  Do you know much about the planets or the universe?, I love to fish. the oldest goldfish lived to be 43 years old
881,142,9/4/2021 17:02, I know a little bit. I've heard that Venus does not tilt. ," Wow that is a long life for a goldfish! I like to go crabbing too. I heard the seahorse is the only fish with a neck, I"
1434,143,10/13/2021 5:59, That interesting.  Uranus is different to.  It actually rotates sideways and rolls around the sun rather than spins like the other planets., THere was a koi fish that lived 226 years
1092,144,10/10/2021 15:22, That's really interesting. I've also heard that Jupiter's moon Ganymede would be considered a planet if it orbited the sun. , Whoa! That is crazy to know and interesting. I know there is a breed of jellyfish that is immortal.
428,145,9/19/2021 16:47, It must be pretty big then!  I wouldn't want to ever visit the unnamed planet where shards of glass precipitate sideways at 4500 mph!, Cool the barreleye fish has a transparent head.
1005,146,9/28/2021 15:41, I don't see that being a pleasant place. It's even 2000 degree weather. That sounds like hell to me!," Awesome. I heard that saltwater fish dink water through their mouths and through their skin, while a freshwater fish only drinks through their skin. Fish are fascinating."
715,147,10/13/2021 19:54, Hahah That's a good way of putting it! , That is pretty cool. Do you like to bird watch?
1468,148,9/28/2021 10:01," Well I have to get to work, I hope you have a good day. It was nice chatting with you!"," There are times when i Do like to look at the birds, how about you? Did you know that birds bones are really hollow. So hollow in fact that their skeleton weighs less than their feathers."
1367,149,8/29/2021 16:55, Can you believe there is stars that can be cold enough to be touched ? The universe is so diverse. , thats neat. They have then thousand living species.
1088,150,9/19/2021 10:06, Its amazing and ever evolving. ," That's cool. Some birds are known to fly from Alaska to mexico without sleeping, that is tiring to think about."
71,151,10/5/2021 13:04, Yeah and there is even places that exist but we never will be able to see because they are too far away. , o wow. I wonder how many days that takes. Scientist say birds have regional accents.
310,152,9/23/2021 5:01, They are saying space pulls galaxies outside of universe that we could see," That is cool how they even have accents like humans. My favorite is the hummingbird, they are tiny sometimes about 2 inches long."
1318,153,9/19/2021 15:14," Yes that is what I was saying, albeit I doubt that there is only one electron in the universe like some people say. ", They are the smallest birds and the ostrich is the biggest. Some birds don't fly.
1281,154,8/23/2021 21:10, I don't see anything supporting or denying that theory so we would never know for sure. , This reminds me of the extinct dodo bird. They were actually a sub-family of pigeons.
1022,155,9/5/2021 6:41," Yeah, but only one ? For all the universe ? It does not seems logic ...", pigeons are one of 3 birds that produce milk for their young.
934,156,9/28/2021 17:15, There is only one sun that warms earth and all other planets so why not just one electron? , Very cool. Pigeons are very pretty birds.
1043,157,9/22/2021 5:05," Because an electron is part of matter, the water you drink, the chair you sit on. Saying there is only 1 electron in the universe is like saying there is 1 grain of wheat in your bread.  ", Hi do you like tennis?
157,158,8/24/2021 13:27, It makes sense when you put it that way but in terms of that universe size the electron could be very big., Oh yeah! I pick up a racket and hit the net when I can!
1064,159,9/1/2021 22:14, Maybe they did mean to say that our universe is contained in an electron in another universe ?, Nice!  Did you know that polo shirts were invented for tennis and only later adopted by polo players?
1424,160,10/2/2021 17:38," I don't know but I am at the end of knowledge on this subject. What do you think about the facts of comics? I would have thought US invented them, but it's Japan or UK."," Ha! That's weird! I didn't know that! Tennis has an interesting history. Did you know that until 1978, a tennis player could use any object as a racket?"
255,161,9/25/2021 13:17," Japan has a great printing history, I am not surprised about this. Do you read comics books ? I have read a few but not about super-heroes. ", Nice!  I wonder if anyone ever tried to use something wacky?  A black man won the 1st US open tennis title in 1968 and no black man has won it since.
1478,162,10/6/2021 5:49," I used to in my childhood but not any more, I used to love inspector Gadget. "," Wow! Not since 1968? You know, Serena Williams has increasingly found her voice and spoken out against gender and racial inequality. "
1022,163,8/25/2021 8:06, Was Inspect Gadget a comics on Paper or a cartoon on TV ? I was talking about what Marvel is publishing.," Yes!  Did you know that she speaks fluent French and Italian, as does her sister Venus!"
123,164,9/7/2021 11:31, On Paper and yes I do recall seeing Super-hero and Hulk books.," She is truly fascinating! She does it all! She is the first tennis player, male or female, to achieve the career Golden Slam in both singles and doubles. That means she won at least one Australian Open title, French Open title, Wimbledon title, US Open title, and Olympic Gold medal."
887,165,9/4/2021 3:58," I think that Hulk is in the Marvel universe. But like I said, I never read anything from Marvel nor DC comics. ", That's pretty incredible!  They used a helicopter to dry the grass tennis courts for the 1969 US Open.
1213,166,9/19/2021 14:51," Right me neither, there were so many good choices of comics when I was growing up. "," That's a little before Serena's time! Although, did you know she went pro in tennis at the age of 13?! I could barely even get a ball over the net when I was 13!"
673,167,9/8/2021 1:48," Not where I lived, if I want to read a comic book, I had to go to the library. But as I think about it Tintin is a comic book, so I was wrong, I did read a lot of them when I was young but they were European.  ", lol  I do remember that.  Both her and her sister brought alot of good publicity to the sport.
1437,168,9/3/2021 16:42," Mine all time favorite was Bozo the clown, books and TV both. "," That is for sure! Two girls from Compton came and conquered! In total, Serena has been Number 1 for 319 weeks! "
910,169,9/1/2021 10:55," I did saw a lot of cartoons on TV, but I don't think that considered as a comic book. have a nice day. ", That is incredible!  The longest match in tennis history went on for 11 hours and was spread over 3 days.  Wow!
429,170,9/4/2021 13:35, Are you a Star Wars fan? I need to rewatch the OT and the prequels so I can watch the subsequent stuff for the first time and understand what's going on., Are you kidding me! Three days?! That's a long time! I don't have that kind of patience! Speaking of long records... did you know the longest point in pro tennis history was a 643 shot rally? 
605,171,9/12/2021 6:41," Hi! Yes, I am a huge fan of Star Wars! I also loved how it was the first major movie to be dubbed in Navajo! I think that is so cool!", Wow!  That would have been fun to watch...not so fun for the players. lol
111,172,10/12/2021 17:06," Yeah, that's wild. I guess it takes a pretty small audience to pay for the translation work."," Yeah! It lasted 29 minutes! I bet it was pretty exhilarating, but also probably pretty exhausting! I would certainly be out of breath after 29 minutes!"
575,173,9/9/2021 5:42," Agreed. Isn't it also funny James Earl Jones only spent two and half hours recording his lines for Darth Vader? I also can't believe he was only paid $7500! Geez, that's pocket change.", lol me too.  Are you a fan of rap music?
1210,174,9/5/2021 16:11, $7500 is amazingly low. I guess since Darth Vader was masked Jones could just record everything at once in the studio.," Oh yeah! Tennis reminds me a little of rap, since they're both so fast paced. Did you know the world's fastest rapper can rap at a rate of 14.1 syllables per second?"
1125,175,10/6/2021 3:12," Agreed. Can you also believe that George Lucas' wife at the time, Marcia, won an academy award for her editing on Star Wars and yet George Lucas didn't win an academy award for directing. That is just downright unbelievable!", Holy smokes I wouldn't be able to listen that fast!  lol  It's been fun chatting with you!
315,176,9/17/2021 0:32, A lot of people think the OT was so much better than the prequels because of her influence.," Then maybe you could try the deaf rapper, Signmark. He rhymes in sign language! You don't have to listen at all! I'm going to go try to find some on the internet. Goodbye!"
1423,177,9/22/2021 10:33," Yeah it was because of her that so many major changes were made like Leia's good luck kiss, Obi Wan's death, etc. She was truly a big influence!", I'll have to look him up!  Have a great night!
707,178,10/8/2021 13:09," I remember thinking just about everything in the prequels' timeline was off, based on the mental version of the past the OT led us to construct. But I'd have to rewatch to nail it down.", What do you think of Serena Williams?
334,179,9/10/2021 0:38, Yeah I would have to watch it as well! So are you also a fan of Chewbacca? I love him. I think it's funny there's a bat species called the Chewbacca bat. That's hilarious!, I really like her! 
943,180,10/12/2021 0:25, I never felt strongly about Chewbacca one way or the other TBH. But I've got to google a picture of that bat to see what it looks like!, Have you seen the Nike ads?
705,181,9/12/2021 11:12, I would like to see it as well. Did you know Chewbacca actually had a wife and two boys? That's pretty interesting!, I haven't but I hear they are really powerful messages in this age of people stepping forward about sexual harassment.
1474,182,9/12/2021 4:32, I vaguely recall reading something in the Star Wars fictional universe where a young Han Solo stayed with Chewbacca and his mom in their home., It is all about there is no wrong way to be a woman.
971,183,9/13/2021 10:03," That's so weird, isn't it? Ha! Are you one of the fans who believes both r2d2 and Chewbacca were secret rebel agents? I kind of think it's an interesting theory. "," Yes, ans inequality among races and gender. I like Serena."
1440,184,9/24/2021 5:23," I wish I knew enough about the background to have an opinion, but the last Star Wars I watched was Episode III, when it came out on video. I really need to rewatch to refresh my memory of it. ", I really think she is a great driving force and a good role model to girls.
966,185,10/1/2021 3:23," Same here! Like, I also had forgotten that before his companionship with Chewbacca, Hans Solo was an imperial lieutenant!"," Yes, definitely! I agree. She is happy to have such a powerful platform to try and pave the way for upcoming generations. "
952,186,9/8/2021 1:18," Yeah, I don't remember that at all. He definitely doesn't seem like the type.", Very true.  Did you now polo shirts were initially invented be a famous tennis player?
1165,187,10/13/2021 6:06," Indeed he doesn't. But I've always liked Chewbacca because he reminded me of a giant dog. Ha! Speaking of dogs, I think it's cool that dogs, along with elephants, are the only animals that understand pointing!", That is interesting! Did you know in Tennis years ago you were allowed to use any object as your racket? Haha
1121,188,8/26/2021 16:47," I wouldn't be surprised if cats understood it but just didn't care, LOL."," Really, like a shoe?"
974,189,8/30/2021 16:50," Ha! No kidding. Speaking of dogs and cats, I like how Google prefers dogs over cats and even states in their code of conduct that they're a dog company! That is awesome!", Any object! So yes lol....must have been interesting!! As funny as if you grunt...before a shot...it is by some considered to be cheating!
1460,190,9/20/2021 17:41," Yeah, that's a weird official policy for what's supposed to be a neutral search engine! Nice chatting with you."," Really, there is so much grunting in tennis.  The longest match was 11 hours long over 3 days!"
695,191,10/6/2021 11:40," Naming a cloned cat ""copy cat"", that's cute."," Wow, I could never last that long! Speaking of Serena Williams, I didn't know she went pro at age 13! That is amazing....and she is co owner of the Miami Dolphins...wow!"
1187,192,10/3/2021 8:17, You must have ESP. I was going to tell you teh same thing! I have a sad story to tell there are less tigers living in the wild in Asia than as pets in the US.," She co-owns the dolphins and was a pro at 13!  Wow, she is really incredible."
142,193,9/7/2021 5:11, Really? That's awful to hear!, I think she is! Speaking of amazing...imagine this...the worlds fastest rapper can rap 14.1 syllables per second! 
1172,194,9/13/2021 11:44, Of Roosevelt's 20 pets two were a bear and hyena!," That is crazy, can anyone even understand that?"
1390,195,9/30/2021 17:11," Whoa, cool! I know he seemed to be quite the animal lover."," I am not sure but I would love to hear it! Talk about funny, McDonald's at one time paid rappers 5 bucks every time they said Big Mac in their songs hahahaa....crazy"
597,196,9/22/2021 4:31," And there are more pets in Japan than there are children under 15. You can't be a pets ""OWNER"" in Boulder but you can be their guardian.  ", I bet they were dropping Big Mac lines like crazy!
961,197,9/10/2021 18:32, I have a pet. I am an ailurophile meaning I love cats.," I bet they were too! lol! There is even a rapper who is deaf! he raps in sign language, very interesting!"
1333,198,9/12/2021 5:31, Cool word! Did you know there are 20 quintillion animal varieties on Earth?," Wow, Id like to watch that.  Great Chat!  Have a great night!"
1286,199,10/9/2021 0:05, That is a lot! And in 2002 Germany gave them legal rights., hi how are you doing over there on that side of the internets
676,200,9/22/2021 22:51," Yeah, and the Loch Ness monster is protected under the 1912 Scottish Animal Protection Act.", Hi! Hope you're doing well! So are you a fan of The Walt Disney Company? One of my favorite characters is Minnie Mouse and I was surprised to recently find out her name is short for Minerva Mouse!
227,201,9/6/2021 17:32, I wonder if the immortal jellyfish needs protecting... being immortal and all., i like disney though i havent watched a disney film in a while. i do like minnie. she is cute as the dickens.
1476,202,9/21/2021 13:40," Lol...speaking of water animals, did you know that hiccoughs are a left over from evolution when we had gills?"," Well there's actually a hidden subculture dedicated to finding hidden Mickey mouse images in all things Disney, you should definitely check out!"
1071,203,9/12/2021 22:32," Maybe that connection is part of why 84% of human disease genes have counterparts in zebrafish, too... hmm."," i guess if you find a mickey, you win something? if i find one, i guess i should tell others and not keep it secret."
1370,204,9/3/2021 18:27, Hmm? Good theory. Seeing that the most popular pets are cats and dogs it is no surprise that they are commonly used for therapy in hospitals.," That's a good point! Ha! Unless they change the locations up!  Are you also a fan of Bill Nye? He actually served as a science consultant on Flubber, believe it or not!"
72,205,9/7/2021 15:50," Well, they are good at helping people adjust to new situations, too.", i guess he knows a bit about the science of hypothetical substances. he is an entertaining fellow for sure.
415,206,9/1/2021 20:20," Yes, like for elderly who are without companions."," Indeed he is! I also think it's amazing that Big Hero 6 was rendered with a 55,000 core supercomputer. That is amazing!"
600,207,10/3/2021 20:32," Or people with anxiety and depression, or kids with autism.", that is astonishing. i wonder how many processors theyll need for big hero 7. i dint see the other big hero movies.
254,208,9/16/2021 5:06," Yes, a seahorse wouldn't be very good for that purpose. Did you know seahorses are the only fish with a neck?"," Probably a lot more than 55,000. Ha! Did you ever see Wall-E? If so, the name is actually a tip of the hat to Walter Elias Disney himself!"
1422,209,9/30/2021 6:08, I don't think a black swallower fish would be good as a companion pet either because it can eat prey twice its length!, that is cute. i wondered why they pickt such a strange name for a robot but now i see. but he dint have a mustache.
842,210,9/27/2021 15:18, That would freak me out! But I bet it catches that prey using its acoustic communication!," You're right, I don't think he did! Ha! I'd like to see Wall-E with factual hair like Kanye West's. I bet that'd be funny. Speaking of Kanye, you know he believes aids is man made? "
1426,211,9/4/2021 2:31, Could be. Fish are cool like that. I think it's neat that amphibians and reptiles and birds and mammals all had the same ancestry with fish., yes Kanye is an oddball when it comes to science. 
1027,212,9/28/2021 4:20, I wonder if reptiles are considered ectothermic like most fish?, That is true. But he does do cool stuff every now again like the time he gave his mic to a fan in a wheelchair at one of his concerts. That was nice of him!
1254,213,9/16/2021 14:30," That would be a good thing to know, especially because some of them make good pets.", i think that he undersatnds entertainment good but he doesnt have the knowledge for science. 
436,214,9/16/2021 13:03," Yep, but I don't know if walking a gecko would give the same health benefits as walking a dog", True. I loved how he did an SNL skit where he mocked himself interrupting award shows ironically two years before he interrupted Taylor Swift at an award show. Ha!
1012,215,10/1/2021 14:56, Probably not. Dog walking is good because it gives companionship and exercise at the same time., he knew the depths of his depravity and told the whole world first. i think that is honest of him 
116,216,9/23/2021 4:51," Hey, did you know the first marine predator was the shark? They developed in the Silurian period."," Agreed. Since we're on the subject of rap, are you a fan of Tupac. I'm so glad his music is in the library of Congress of cultural significance. He was a talented musician!"
634,217,10/11/2021 15:41, Very interesting. I wonder how many aquatic species have gone extinct since then...," Tupac is not my cup of tea but the man could rap the street an urban lullaby. Anyway, great chat!"
1037,218,9/19/2021 3:52, Or have evolved into other species. The shark has a higher core temperature than other fish because it is an active swimmer., Indeed he could! I also think Eminem can as well. I'm glad he became a rapper instead of becoming a comic book artist as he wanted to do growing up. Oh what might have been!
1465,219,10/9/2021 21:02, That makes sense. I always thought sharks were pretty interesting because they have cartilage instead of bone., he could still DO that! the man has got years in front of him and tales of the street to tell. Have a good one!
12,220,9/19/2021 13:28," Yes, fascinating fact! Tuna also hold a higher core temperature. They are in the same class as shark because they are also active swimmers."," So true. And speaking of Eminem, it's hilarious the judge who was trying a suit against Eminem back in 2001 delivered her ruling in the form of a rap. Glad some judges still have a sense of humor. Ha! Well it was great chatting with you! Take care!"
1117,221,9/8/2021 18:07," Tuna can get quite large, too. It's cool how big some fish get.", You too! have a good night!
726,222,9/1/2021 1:07, One more before we go...did you know domesticated animals develop a white patch on their forehead?, You have a good evening as well. I'm off to watch the Rugrats movie to see if I recognize Busta Rhymes' voice in it as the Reptar wagon. Ha! Take care!
1438,223,10/10/2021 15:29, Yeah. that is a pretty cool way to know they are domesticated rather than wild., Disney Land & World released officlal Mickey Mouse ears - rainbow colors - for Pride Month recently. Disney??? When did they wake upd & get tolerant??
863,224,10/2/2021 8:39, Very cool chatting with you. Did you know there are 6331 groups of genes? They are common to all living animals!," Yeah that is interesting. I guess they started that in 2018, it sounds like a lot of people on Twitter were upset too"
1425,225,9/26/2021 1:00, It was a cool exercise in zoology chatting with you., About Pride Month or something else?
108,226,10/12/2021 11:29, I think its sad to have to part with a pet due to allergies and couple conflict like in the Dear Amy section.," I think they were mad that one of the rapper's was supporting president Trump, and they were very happy to hear that Disney was making the LGBT ears or something like that, I don't pay attention to Twitter so I'm not a hundred percent sure"
879,227,9/15/2021 3:10, That is sad. Do you have pets? The first cloned pet was a cat and its name was copy cat.," Got it. Yeah, the rapper is Kanye West. Another singer, John Legend, asked West to ""reconsider"""
560,228,9/15/2021 11:27," Yes, I have a dog.  Sounds like in the Dear Amy that they do everything tit for tat. The cat owner states that her fiance has to get rid of his saltwater fish if she gets rid of her cat.  That's not necessarily fair though I don't think.  They seem like they may struggle as a couple in the future."," Speaking of Disney, what are you like about their movies? Did you know that for instance Minnie Mouse's real name is Minerva LOL"
1315,229,9/1/2021 18:54, Yeah that's a bit dramatic! A cat lover is known as an ailurophile and a dog lover is known as a cynophile.," Nope. Glad they used the nickname, Minnie. What's your favorite Disney film?"
1437,230,9/26/2021 21:47, Allergies can be serious to people.  I understand his reserve of having a cat.," I really like The Little Mermaid and I also like The Lion King, what about you? I don't really like Wall-e myself"
362,231,9/9/2021 0:25," Me too. A pet or companion animal is an animal kept primarily for a person's company, protection, or entertainment. No one should have to be made uncomfortable by a pet in the house."," Lion King was a fav of mine. Loved James Earl Jones, who voiced the father lion character. Little Mermaid had some great music like ""Under the Sea"". Disney is a huge studio today"
661,232,9/18/2021 11:59," I'm sure she loves the pet, but she has to make a choice if the pet is harming her fiance."," Yes I agree with you! I also like the movie Big Hero 6, have you seen it? Apparently it was rendered using a 55000 core supercomputer"
912,233,9/25/2021 17:45, Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described. I'm sure they can find one to agree on. , Haven't seen. Wonder what that computer looks like - Apple makes a lot of computers used by artists & filmmakers.
139,234,8/23/2021 22:00, Did you ever hear that animals develop white patches on their foreheads when they are domesticated?  That's a new one to me.  ," Yep you're right about that. Back to Kanye West though, what do you think about him giving a mic to one of his fans in a wheelchair at a concert? That was nice of him"
328,235,10/10/2021 9:56," That's interesting! Of the 1.5 million species, 1 million are insects! Yuck!"," Agree, but calling Trump a ""brother"" went too far. Trump is no bro! Kanye is big music celeb, though."
983,236,10/9/2021 19:39," Apparently, there is a breed of jellyfish that is immortal.  If you want to live forever, you can look into being a jellyfish."," Yeah, he's definitely an interesting guy, his ideas are not always good though, for instance he thinks that aids is a man-made disease"
877,237,10/3/2021 22:52," Fascinating! In japan, there are more pets than there are children under 15."," Heard that. Since when did people create viruses like HIV? West has made a lot of big $$$ producing records, fwith influences from soul, to electro to gospel."
491,238,9/24/2021 21:08," Teddy Roosevelt had over 20 pets and his own real ""teddy"" bear along with a hyena"," Yes that's a really crazy thing. Kind of like when he mocked himself on SNL for interrupting someone at an awards show, and then did it in real life to Taylor Swift, definitely the guy has some issues"
114,239,10/6/2021 5:29, Wow! There are more tigers living as pets in the us than living wild in asia.," Think so. His main genre, Rap, is huge, though. Has lots of components, like what is said, rhythm or flow, and tone. Are you a fan of Rap?"
1260,240,9/9/2021 1:40," I never met anyone with a tiger pet.  That is strange.  It's not legal to own pets in Boulder, Colorado but you can be their guardian."," Yes I do like rap. I mostly like Tupac Shakur stuff, apparently some of his music is in the Library of Congress actually"
833,241,10/8/2021 3:09," Lots of places have special animal rights. In 2002, germany became the first country in the world to universally give animals constitutionally-guaranteed legal rights.", 'bout time. Some folks say Rap/hip-hop definitely has West African roots - and is based on religious worship. 
1253,242,9/14/2021 16:57, The loch ness monster is protected by 1912 Scottish provisions," Yeah I can see that. I would like to see a compliment battle actually, those are really popular in Korea, I think it's a much more positive thing than a diss battle that I usually see"
537,243,8/31/2021 10:09, That's funny. It's not even a proven species. There are about 20 quintillion individual animals on planet earth.," Great idea. Some rap lyrics don't seem to have anything to do w/praise, do they?"
1465,244,9/15/2021 13:44, Did you ever hear of people being contacted due to DNA matches?  You can opt in or out but might be connected with matches of family members," Yes, mostly they are meant to make fun of other people LOL but I think a compliment battle is actually a very smart thing and would promote positivity"
659,245,9/2/2021 3:28," That is pretty cool. There are several companies offering DNA testing, and each seems to offer a different way of handling client privacy"," Humans may have lost their body hair as recently as 240,000 years ago. Do you know ?"
821,246,9/27/2021 10:25, DNA matches could be connected via social media.," That is fascinating, also like the evidence scientists discovered in New Mexico, ancient humans against giant sloths."
1464,247,9/30/2021 6:40," hi, do you like fish?", Scientists recently found a human print inside a ground sloth's paw marks.
773,248,10/13/2021 6:36," Yes, I love fish do you?"," It must be really popular as each year about 500,000 people visit the museum, humans dont stop to amaze me!"
735,249,9/1/2021 13:51, yes me too. some of them can eat prey twice their sizew," NIce! Animals and plants synthesize their own vitamin c, But humans cannot."
1463,250,8/26/2021 4:04," Yes, did you know seahorses only fish to have a neck?"," That sure is an interesting fact, you know humans can regrow ribs and they will be as strong as before in about 2-3 months"
1407,251,9/20/2021 16:12," that is so cool, and the males carry the young in that species"," Yes, But there is a sound frequency that causes fear in humans."
602,252,9/16/2021 21:30," Yes, and zebrafish are very interesting.", I bet that frequency is used a lot in horror films.
1058,253,9/21/2021 2:46, yeah did you know we use them to figure out stufffor ourselves, Yes. Both human and animals are live together. I make our eco-system. The special branch of science to study animals is called zoology.
816,254,8/30/2021 3:31," Yes interesting,  How about the first cloned cat named copy cat?", Its amazing how there are more than 7 million species of animals and there are more to discover.
1494,255,10/7/2021 5:53, that is cool. there is a jellyfish that is immortal, There are about 20 quintillion animals on planet earth.
733,256,10/8/2021 4:08," I know, really? How about our hiccups are from gills and lungs?"," Wow, that is a lof animals for sure, you know that animals have constitutional rights in Germany?"
1496,257,9/14/2021 2:34," that is a such a cool fact, we are still evolving so maybe it will eventually go away"," In 1912 Scottish protection of animals act, the loch ness monster is a protected species."
935,258,9/23/2021 16:10," lol, interesting to know the loch ness monster is a protected species."," Really? I though the Loch Ness monster was a myth, or maybe its a  safety measure in case they actually discover the monster."
110,259,10/6/2021 4:03, yet no one has really seen it to confirm its existence, Alaska has had a cat named stubbs as its mayor since 1997.
416,260,9/20/2021 13:52," I know, Also, I do believe in Japan there is less people under 15 years of age than pets."," I wonder how mayor Stubbs makes all the decisions lol, did you watch the movie The Godfather?"
622,261,10/4/2021 11:04, do you know how many idnividual animals are believed to be on earth?, There are cat cafes in Japan and Taiwan where people can pay hourly to play with cats and have drinks.
1214,262,9/24/2021 15:29," Yes, 20 quintillion, can you believe that?Wow"," Not sure if I would pay for that lol, do you have a cat?"
351,263,9/25/2021 11:02, I do not even know how many zeros are in that number," Yes, Its very naughty and its one of family memebers."
460,264,9/29/2021 5:42," lol, I know, I guess  the US have more tigers as pets than living wild in Asia."," I also have a cat, Ive always wondered what breed it is since there are over 70 breeds registered."
714,265,9/19/2021 1:18, and Roosevelet did not have any of them, Amazing! Its very nice to hear this.
415,266,9/1/2021 3:49, He did have a bear and hyena. Good to know you are a guardian not an owner in Colorado to pets.," You know the cat in The Godfather, well it was actually a stray cat that happened to be around the set, I bet its life change forever as it is now a movie star."
425,267,10/4/2021 1:05, I like that too. nice chat, do you know much about humans?
675,268,9/1/2021 19:13, Hello, I know that we lost the body hair only quarter of a million years ago
667,269,8/26/2021 0:45, Hello.  do you have a cat?  I see that some people can be allergic to them., pretty recent. Do you know why we are good persistence runners?
1073,270,10/8/2021 9:39," No, I do not.  I am actually allergic to cats.  The first cloned pet was a cat and its name was copy cat", that is because we used to be hunters and that came in handy
1430,271,10/11/2021 9:39," That's interesting and a little funny.  I had no idea of this, but the cat is the most popular pet in the world.  DId you know that?", yeah. Did you know we are the only ones that cannot synthesize vitamin c ourselves?
758,272,10/6/2021 16:00," Wow, no I didn't know that.  There are more tigers living as pets in the us than living wild in asia.", yeah we are missing the enzyme that helps with that
420,273,9/13/2021 7:43, Now that I had no idea of.  Did you know that some tarantulas keep frogs as pets?, Yeah. Did you know there is a sound frequency that scares us?
61,274,9/27/2021 19:41," Wow, that's odd. Two of the most popular pets are dogs and cats", I really want to know what that sounds like
1452,275,9/28/2021 12:23, I have dogs and used to have cats too but dogs are my favorite.  , Me too. ANd we can regrow ribs if they are surgically removed
809,276,9/15/2021 14:49, Dogs are my favorite also.  I hope to get another one in the future., yes and in only 2-3 months and just as strong as before
49,277,9/28/2021 7:01, Do you have any now?  I have two., Yeah. Do you know how many individual animals are there?
1172,278,9/13/2021 23:53," No, I do not.  What kind do you have?  84 per cent of genes known to be associated with human diseases have counterparts in the zebrafish", About 20 quintillion but I have no idea how many zeroes it has
508,279,8/23/2021 3:21, I have a beagle and a border collie.  I had no idea about that with the zebrafish. I wonder if cures can be found by using their genes., Haha true. Do you have a pet?
88,280,9/11/2021 23:26, I used to have a collie named Bimbo.  That's a great question.," I have a dog and two cats, and you?"
1130,281,9/4/2021 18:21, Mine is named Cute Stuff.  Did you know about the fish that lives on land? I wonder what it is., I have just a dog. Do your pets have white patches in the forehead?
88,282,9/23/2021 17:58," No, I didn't.  There is a breed of jellyfish that is immortal"," they do not but I hear domesticated animals develop them, weird"
1007,283,10/6/2021 5:57, Seriously?  I thought they just evaporated in the sun?," Yeah I know  mine do not have them either, confusing a bit"
84,284,10/7/2021 16:56," Absolutely, There are about 20 quintillion individual animals on planet earth.", Agreed. DO you know why we have hiccups?
1434,285,10/7/2021 1:26, And who knows how many that are undiscovered.  Animals are truly fascinating!, that us from back in the day when animals had gills and lungs
1128,286,9/3/2021 18:25," Yes, they are.  In 2002, germany became the first country in the world to universally give animals constitutionally-guaranteed legal rights.", Yeah. Do you know what the Loch Ness Monster is?
105,287,10/9/2021 21:28, I think that is a good thing!  I like how the netherlands is constructing wildlife bridges., Yes that is the believed to be monster in Scotland
726,288,8/31/2021 3:11, Me too. Thanks for the informative chat., Do you like Tennis?
1112,289,8/29/2021 18:05," Hello, Did you know that there are over 1.5 million living animal species?"," I do not, but I am a fan of Serena Williams, ever since she voiced a character in Avatar; The Last Airbender."
1082,290,10/3/2021 11:37," No, that was chock  full of interesting facts. Hiccups are residual from when we had gills and lungs? Interesting stuff.", I didn't know she did that.  She speaks fluent French and Italian.
608,291,8/24/2021 3:03," Never heard that one before, lol! There is a fish called the black swallower that is capable of eating prey twice its length and 10 times its own weight."," She's great. There is a rapper who is deaf, and rhymes in sign language."
1328,292,9/21/2021 9:04, I knew one of those in my fraternity in college I think. I was shocked to learn there is a breed of jellyfish that is immortal. Only creature on earth that can claim that here on the planet.," That is interesting.  Tupac Shakur's music is in the library of congress of ""cultural significance"""
1066,293,9/9/2021 9:31," Yeah we all know that guy! how about the loch ness monster being protected under the Scottish 1912 protection of animals act. Creatures of the great deep are extraordinary. ""The immortal Jelly fish. ", Did you know that Serena Williams co-owns the Miami Dolphins?
877,294,9/14/2021 11:34," I already looked up that jellyfish on my phone. Fascinating, yes loch ness is protected and pets in Boulder, Colorado are not owned, but guarded. Interesting how different cultures handle that.", I didn't know that.  In 2007 she was ranked 95th in the world.
144,295,10/6/2021 1:50, Tell me about it apparently there are more U.S. Tigers living as pets than there are living in the wild in Asia.," It's hilarious that McDonalds pays rappers $5 for each time they mention big macs in songs. I'm surprised one hasn't just said ""big mac' the entire time."
1200,296,9/17/2021 7:02," Yes, that is sad in some ways too. Happy we're keeping them alive, probably in zoo but going extinct in the wild is a sad statement on the planet today.", lol true!  Big Mac sounds like it would be a good rapper name.  Eminem's true dream was to become a comic book artist before he was a rapper.
1449,297,9/19/2021 3:54, I agree. Germany became the first country to universally give animals constitutionally-guaranteed rights.  ," Donald Glover's name came from a Wu-Tang Clan name generator. I would have loved to have seen how many he rejected, before settling on ""Childish Gambino""."
1303,298,10/4/2021 16:36," While I'm a pet owner, that going a bit far. Do you give dogs and cats rights, how about those dairy cows or cattle to be eaten. Do they get lesser rights?"," I know right?  Korean rappers invented a new type of freestyle rap called ""compliment battle""  Never heard of that before."
1466,299,8/26/2021 20:55, Very good point. My wife and I are watching Blue Planet. It's shocking some of the things that are down in the deep. they are still making discoveries every single day. Apparently the sea horse is the only fish with a neck. ," It's fascinating to know that the term ""hip hop"" comes from the 16th century, and means ""to converse""."
142,300,9/20/2021 0:38," Yes, and really they say we know more about the face of the moon than the bottom of the ocean. Who knows what's down there we don't know?  Maybe the Loch Ness monster's cousin.", I didn't know that.  In 2001 a Michigan judge delivered a ruling in the form of a rap when judging over a suit filed against Eminem.  I bet that was funny to hear in the court room.
968,301,10/1/2021 19:30," If you ever get a chance you should check this show, there's some amazing creatures down there. 84% of genes that are associated with diseases have counterparts in the Zebrafish. ", That is funny. It is asinine that grunting can be considered cheating in tennis. How insane is that?
273,302,9/30/2021 8:34, I read that and thought the same. I wonder how similar the Zebra Fish is to humans? Can we use that in medical research?, I agree.  It's always so quiet during tennis matches.
978,303,8/31/2021 0:26," If we can i'm sure it will be preventative or medication. There's no money in cures. I didn't realize that we had already cloned a cat and named it Copy Cat, that's too funny.", I would have liked to have seen the matches when they were permitted to use anything as a racket. I think they ended that in the 70's.
854,304,9/29/2021 16:19," Yes, the scientist in that experiment had a sense of humor. Related to domestication, I had no idea that domesticated animals develop a white patch on their foreheads. I wonder what causes that, it doesn't seem to have any evolutionary reason to me.", That would have been interesting.  Polo shirts were originally invented bor tennis and later adopted for polo players.
655,305,9/10/2021 20:50, Sounds strange. I can't fathom why anyone would want a rat for a pet. I'm a little leery of guinea pigs and ferrets. anything with red eyes you can keep.  ," I just admire Serena for speaking up for women's rights, even though it comes at a great personal cost to her. She truly is a warrior for women."
431,306,10/9/2021 14:12," Haha, yep. A snake doesn't seem very warm or comforting either. I don't understand why people enjoy having them as pets. And how do they find partners who accept it?", I agree.  In 1998 she shaid that both she and her sister Venus could beat any man ranked 200 or worse.  
192,307,9/2/2021 10:03," Other people who like that stuff i guess, haha. Apparently Theodore Roosevelt had 20 pets including a bear and Hyena. I wonder if he played with them much? ", I have zero ideas how rankings work in tennis. I think it is appalling for a little girl to be told she was too black for tennis whites. That is the epitome of racism right there.
232,308,9/20/2021 23:42," Well, President of the United States, I wonder if he had them in the White House? Did he have a stable for the bear out back?", You know it!  
1263,309,9/26/2021 1:36, Some animals just should be domesticated. That white patch if true is something to ponder. , Hi Do you know that disney has a new line of Mickey ears 
736,310,9/23/2021 21:28," Yes indeed, interesting facts that will give me pause this weekend. That was an enjoyable conversation. Thanks and have a lovely weekend."," AWWW, really? How cute and I would love to get some for my kids. I love Minnie her actually name is Minerva. Cute."
152,311,9/20/2021 0:01, You as well!!, Wall e was given that name to remember walter disney
225,312,9/27/2021 21:06, Thanks.," How adorable. I never knew that. We are really into the subcultural of finding the hidden mickey mouse image in all things disney, its a fun hobby. "
1082,313,9/12/2021 20:57," hey hows it going, do you know what the first cloned animal was?", yeah had seen few videos of the easter eggs of mickey in every production
166,314,8/23/2021 20:22," Was it a sheep? I heard the first cloned pet was a cat, though. Its name was copy cat. That is funny!"," Oh wow, thats cool. I never heard about that one either. I know Bill Nye was involved with disney, he is a funny scientist. "
619,315,9/5/2021 8:22," haha ya I like that, what is also wild to me is that there are more domesticated tigers living as pets than there are wild tigers living around asia", for flubber well pretty rare to involve a scientist for a fictional movie. . good move by the team
1332,316,10/13/2021 10:40," Wow, that is weird and sad. Speaking of which, did you hear about the tiger found in the duffel bag?"," Yea, good point. It was a great movie and well done. I havent watched it in a really long time though. Disney changed its name in 1986. They make bold moves."
99,317,10/2/2021 14:35," no that is really sad, poor tiger what happened to it? Why was it in a bag?", bold moves  may be a  album with Kanye west would be boldest and unimaginable
577,318,9/14/2021 18:29, I guess it was being smuggled to the USA from Mexico.," Oh boy, yeah. Kayne West I heard that he believes AIDS is a man made disease. huh?"
826,319,10/12/2021 9:12," ya I don't like that that makes me mad, do you have any pets? I guess In Japan there are more pets than there are kids under the age of fifteen", really ? I think something is wrong with that man
1155,320,9/16/2021 0:31," They really love their pets huh? No, I don't have any pets. Do you?"," Yeah, odd thinking. He also did a skit about interrupting on awards show 2 years prior to really doing it. The skit was on SNL and he was mocking himself.  "
878,321,9/4/2021 2:01," no we used to have a dog but we were only watching her for a bit and the owner took her away, we had lots of pets as kids though like iguanas and rabbits and such", still could not to resist to do it with taylor . Oh boy he truly know about his future may be he was feeling dejavu
1202,322,10/4/2021 1:37," In Boulder, Colorado you cannot own a pet. You can be their guardian though."," Yeah, good point. Out of the top 10 most successful songs of all time is one of his actually."
1452,323,10/9/2021 4:09," hmm that seems dumb like its just playing with words, do you like Teddy Roosevelt? apparently he had over 20 pets, or as they say in Colorado, ""Guardians"" haha", pretty much unbelievable may be he should save his talent only for music and avoid talk shows
893,324,9/19/2021 8:11," Maybe it helps people to feel more of an obligation to their pets. Shrug. Yeah, Teddy Roosevelt is an interesting guy. It's unfortunate though that people try to domesticate tigers as you mentioned. Many of the animals perish along the way from suffocation or hunger. ", Thats some sound advice! His Gold Digger song was really fun to listen to but thats about it.
582,325,9/14/2021 19:28," ya that makes me really sad, what do you think about fish? I had salmon for dinner so I do think theyre tasty haha", Do you know that eminem's dream is to become a comic book artist
1263,326,8/31/2021 10:00, Haha. Funny. I don't eat seafood. My mom forced me to eat salmon way too often when I was little and I grew sick of it. Haha #firstworldproblems.," No way, really? I like him but never knew that. I heard that Tupac has music in the library of congress as cultural significance,. That is pretty cool, I think."
1360,327,8/29/2021 20:08," haha ya, well I am like the black swallower fish, I could eat a salmon twice my height and ten times my weight because I love it", Once a judge gave her ruling in form of Rap where eminem is charged 
1141,328,9/25/2021 12:14, Funny. I would love to learn more about a jellyfish that is immortal.," HA, thats pretty clever! I guess that Eminem had a favorite character and it was Spiderman. Good thing he stayed with music and rapping."
1330,329,10/7/2021 9:25, I know they need to apply those genes to me! also weird is there is no fish except for the seahorse that has an actual neck, good chatting with you
1391,330,10/5/2021 22:55, So seahorses are salt water right? I guess they drink water though their mouths while freshwater fish only drink through their skin., Are you a fan of Disney?
1006,331,10/8/2021 13:23," yes that would be true, also true is that 84% of human disease genes are also associated with the zebrafish, we need to study that fish too!"," I am, my favorite movie is probably Lion King. What about you?"
1161,332,9/1/2021 0:14, How odd! Do you think the loch ness monster is real? It is a protected species!, Lion King rocks! I think they are making a new one really soon. I liked Beauty and the Beast and even Moana was great
585,333,9/22/2021 22:07," haha I wish it were real! that's funny they did that in 1912, maybe they knew something that we dont?", I really enjoyed the soundtrack of Moana. Beauty and the Beast also had a pretty good one.
1321,334,8/24/2021 15:33, What would you do if you found a baby tiger inside of a duffel bag?, For sure! Did you ever watch Big Hero 6?
903,335,9/28/2021 9:20," I would look around to make sure Mama tiger is not in the area and looking at me with, ""Gimme back my child"" look!"," I have, it was an excellent movie. What about you?"
613,336,9/16/2021 8:48," LOL yep you don't want to be around an angry tiger mom haha. I guess they found one on the southern Border in Texas, a bag with a baby tiger that is"," I liked it a lot, I never knew it was Disney too much while watching it, apparently it was rendered with a 55,000 core supercomputer"
646,337,10/6/2021 6:11, Was it a smuggling thing?, Talk about high tech! Bill Nye was a scientist consultant for Disney's flubber!
971,338,9/12/2021 2:46, Yes I think so unfortunately. the smuggling industry is a billion dollar trade unfortunately," no way! That is awesome, I never knew that. lol. Bill Nye is the man!"
936,339,9/27/2021 18:42," With 20 quintillion animals in this world, why would anyone feel the need to smuggle one?", Pixar also named wall-e after walter elais disney.
1448,340,9/16/2021 15:21," Haha well different animals are definitely worth different amounts, I don't think a mosquito is worth anything LOL. Why do you think animals can get white patches on their foreheads?"," that is a nice shout out to walter disney. I like the other shout outs too, there is a subculture dedicated to finding hidden mickey mouse images in disney things"
978,341,9/1/2021 17:14," Once domesticated, animals develop white patches on their foreheads, likely because once indoors, they run into painted walls and doors with their heads. I know i do."," Speaking of mickey mouse, Minnie mouse was short for Minerva mouse."
864,342,9/1/2021 10:48, Haha I wonder if humans developed these white patches as well. What do you think about Germany giving constitutional rights to animals? They did that back in 2002," no way, all these short names, I never knew that! I wonder where the name Minerva went"
1212,343,10/3/2021 20:13," I think German constitutional right for animals are pretty cool. Pretty, pretty . I learned about that while watching the German remake of the classic film, ""12 angry hamsters""", Do you listen to rap music?
883,344,8/24/2021 17:07," Well I'll have to watch that movie. I just think it's cool that hiccups are relics of When Animals had both lungs and gills, so next time you have the hiccups think about that LOL"," I used to love listening to Rap music, not so much anymore, but still enjoy it. How about you?"
375,345,8/25/2021 17:24, Does that mean putting a bag over your head while hiccupping may cause you to de-evolve? Maybe that is what happened to the Loch Ness Monster! I'm glad  she is a protected species. Hate to think someone might bag Aunt Matilda. , I do not listen to them too much as I prefer other types of music.
1372,346,8/26/2021 3:26," It's funny that it's protected by 1912 Scottish law, the ""protection of animals act"". hopefully that means that it's a real animal LOL but I doubt it"," I like Korean Rap, they have compliment rap battles lol"
405,347,9/2/2021 2:40," Yeah. Aunt Matilda would make a better hag fish anyway, or maybe a seahorse, since they are the only fish with a neck. "," Ah, the infamous k-pop. I have listened to some of that here and there."
762,348,9/29/2021 22:46, That is crazy! I also think it's crazy that there is a jellyfish breed that can never die AKA its immortal," Me too, even North Korea has a form of kpop. It was so nice chatting with you!"
315,349,10/10/2021 12:53," Does that mean they never get cancer, or they get cancer forever? You know, 84% of genes associated with human disease are also found in the zebrafish, but I have never seen a zebrafish with MS or Parkinson's disease...", It was nice chatting with you too! Thank you for you time!
251,350,10/6/2021 10:40," Haha I haven't seen it either! Maybe some people have the black swallower fish disease, because black swallow fish Can Eat Prey twice their length and 10 times their weight haha"," Thank you also, enjoy your night!"
78,351,8/28/2021 6:55," Haha. If  freshwater fish can drink through it's skin, why don't you ever see a freshwater fish floating in a margarita?", Hello. Do you like the Star Wars movies?
1051,352,9/10/2021 10:57, Haha I wish I could drink through my skin and float in a margarita LOL. Do you have any pets by the way?, I love them! some of my favorites. how about you?
235,353,10/3/2021 15:41," Too many to count. We've had Hamsters, snakes, scorpions, lizards, fish, cats, dogs, chickens, birds...Our apartment is getting cramped...", I love them too.  I've even read some of the books and played a few star wars video games.
1260,354,8/26/2021 15:17," Haha that's a lot of animals! We have a dog actually, but I can't believe that there are more pet tigers in the USA than Wild Ones in Asia, a lot of people must have illegal pets here", oh what games have you played? I used to play a lot of them but the more recent ones havent been great
631,355,9/30/2021 21:11, Can you recommend any movies to watch?," Some of the older ones. I can't remember the names off the top of my head but one was a race game, where you raced in ships on different planets/tracks."
359,356,9/15/2021 2:41, Do you like Star Wars ? The movie about Hans Solo just came out on Netflix. , oh probably the Episode 1 podracer game. that was a goood one. I cant believe how successful its become after George Lucas made that one movie way back in the 70s
1080,357,10/13/2021 11:43, Is that the one where its about a young Han Solo?," I know.  Hey, did you know that his wife worked on the movie too?  She even won an academy award."
793,358,9/20/2021 23:48," Yeah it is the one, so Han Solo is not played by Harrison Ford, does it affect your opinion of the movie ?", she did?? what for?
1045,359,10/9/2021 13:59, Someone else can fill Harrison Fords shoes? Maybe ill check into how well this Alden guy does in the role," She did some editing work on some scenes.  She worked on obi wan's death, leia's good luck kiss, and the trench run."
1357,360,9/1/2021 18:28," He did a good job, but Han Solo was already young in the 1977 movie, I think it impacted negatively the movie. ", thats awesome. Did you know Ewan McGregors brother goes by Obi-Two?
289,361,8/27/2021 11:44, Does Chewbacca appear in this movie?," No I didn't but that's neat!  I don't think I asked, but what games do you or did you play?"
395,362,9/25/2021 7:59," Yes it does, but it is not the same actor who did the other movies. I don't think that matters too much. "," I played the old Super Star Wars games on the SNES, and Knights of the Old Republic on Xbox. Those games were awesome"
733,363,9/12/2021 1:39, I like their relationshop in the movies. Chewy is a very loyal friend," Those sound familiar.  Yeah, the older games and movies were better.  Speaking of older, i heard that James Earl Jones only spent a little over two hours recording his Darth Vadar lines and he was paid $7500.  I imagine he'd make a lot more if he were doing that today."
1105,364,9/22/2021 16:05, In the canon Chewy has a family a wife and 2 sons. , he probably would make no less than 100k a day! that voice is so iconic
136,365,9/4/2021 17:04, Thats interesting. I heard George RR Martin had an illustration that Chewie is based off of, It really is.  The Force Awakens movie just didn't do him or Vader justice in my opinion.
945,366,9/8/2021 22:23," I heard that too, it was on the cover of one of his small stories. It is a peculiar creature when you think about it. ", you see I liked Force Awakens a lot. I like Kylo Ren. its a different spin because he conflicted and not just all big bad and evil
1284,367,9/6/2021 9:44, I wonder what other crazy creatures we could have had in space with Martins help. There's a giant fictional Universe that could be filled.," Okay, I got my new movies mixed up. I liked kylo ren too. What I didn't like is seeing Hans Solo die if that's the right movie. The one  I meant about vadar was the new movie about a young darth vadar."
209,368,9/3/2021 21:48, Would you like to  see a film with Chewbacca as the principal character ? , oh yea Han died in Force Awakens. did you know Star Wars is technically responsible for Titanic and Avatar existing?
1076,369,8/27/2021 1:08, I think it would be interesting. There are also so many comic stories that could be told. I just wonder how communication would work in such a movie, No I didn't. How is that?
736,370,9/7/2021 3:17," They would use subtitles. And good storytelling, like how Hans Solo seems to understand Chewie's intentions, but not his words. "," James Cameron decided to join the film industry after watching star wars, he drected those 2 films"
365,371,9/25/2021 8:01, Yeah its like having a dog as a best friend. But able to shoot things, I guess Star Wars is inspiring in more ways than one!
139,372,10/5/2021 4:59, There was also a dog movie that opened this summer A.X.L. about a robot dog. , Hey there what do you think about planet Earth? It's amazing that Earth has only one natural satellite aka the Moon
182,373,9/29/2021 11:52, I will have to check that one out as well. Thanks for your time. have a good day," Oh, really? That is really interesting."
381,374,9/19/2021 4:56," Do you like dogs ? I love them, they were one of the first domesticated animals."," It is interesting, but something that's sad is that four-fifths of the world's natural forests have been destroyed. We need to do better with the planet I think"
1341,375,9/12/2021 11:03, Yes! dogs and elephants can understand pointing," I think so too. I can't believe when the earth was first formed, one day was 5.5 hours long!"
870,376,10/11/2021 22:22, Good Morning! How are you today?, I know right! do you think that days are getting longer overtime? Like will we have a 40 hour day at some point in the future
1197,377,9/12/2021 19:35," Well, you may be on the other side of the fence but I like neither Kanye nor Trump."," I'm not sure, but I hope not, that is way too long!"
183,378,9/1/2021 16:06, I couldn't have said it any better lol. That was such an odd meeting between them two a couple months ago!," What do you think about the United Nations appointing an ambassador to extraterrestrials? I wonder what he does all day, sounds like the most boring job in the world because obviously we haven't had contact yet"
1036,379,8/23/2021 9:57," I recall the time that Kanye stood up to a President when he perceived racism, now he seems to have flipped.  I guess they money makes a big difference,"," It must be very boring. If we ever do have contact, I wonder if they would tell us?"
478,380,9/24/2021 22:03, A very big difference. He even thinks AIDS is a man-made disease!," That's a good point! Scary thing about our current trajectory is that Earth will be out of helium by the year 2100, I know that you love him very important for manufacturing things so I don't know what we'll do"
187,381,9/5/2021 8:55," People love a good conspiracy story.  I think that is how Trump does so well, people believe in the Deep State, and such."," It's very scary to think about, hopefully we don't."
27,382,9/16/2021 7:45, I agree! What kind of music do you like to listen to?," What other interesting fact, is that if all of history was 24 hours, humans would only take up about 1 minute worth of the 24 hours, isn't that wild to think about?"
986,383,8/28/2021 21:46," I'm a kid of the eighties and nineties,  I never really moved on from that alternative rock scene.", It's very interesting. It's amazing how long the earth has sustained life.
693,384,9/20/2021 16:25, Same here! I think rap has been a major significance in the last twenty years though huh?, Yes Earth has been around for a long time for sure. So interesting to me is that Earth is about 71% covered with water. The other 29% is land and various Islands.
1471,385,9/30/2021 23:09," There has been the odd rap song that I like, but for me it's cultural.  I'm just not from the environment most rappers are and can't appreciate their point of view."," Yeah, I found that out a few years ago, there is so much ocean that hasn't been explored. Can you imagine what is in there?"
168,386,9/12/2021 11:12, I agree too! I can't believe a michigan judge once delivered her ruling to eminem in the form of a rap haha., I know right! I always wanted to go treasure hunting and get some gold from like sunken ships or something haha. Do you like science fiction by the way?
1237,387,10/1/2021 20:57," That's kind of cool, I like it when people don't take themselves too seriously.  Like when Kanye made fun of himself on SNL.  If only he'd do it more.", I think it's great to learn about. 
1360,388,9/2/2021 18:41," All he has to do is talk and it happens haha. I give him props though, he once gave his mic to a fan in a wheelchair at a concert. However, I'm sure he told a person to stand up in a wheelchair before too....."," Yes I think it's interesting, one cool thing to is that NASA has a list of space technology words that writers can use so that they are making accurate statements in the movie"
930,389,9/30/2021 9:15," Funny.  Are you one for hats?  Probably not a MAGA hat, but hat's in general? ", That is awesome! I seen something about starship troopers is the only science fiction novel that is used by three of the five branches in the us military.
614,390,9/17/2021 10:49," I wear hats when I'm out hiking, but that is about it, how about you?"," Yep you're right! Have you seen the movie? The movie is really violent but I liked it, it's from the director of Robocop. I can't believe it's on the military reading list though"
287,391,9/30/2021 0:09," Generally not.  I'm originally from the UK so I guess most people would associate me with a bowler hat, but never really worn any type of hat."," Yeah me either! A judge in 1950's tried to ban science fiction comics. Get this, because there was a black character! "
564,392,9/15/2021 19:29, It took me awhile to figure out what it looks like but now I know. Wasn't that the most popular hat in the old west too?," Yeah that's horrible! interesting that the term ""robotic"" was created by a science fiction author, you'd think that it would have been an actual science term, and this happened back in 1941 haha"
122,393,9/5/2021 0:04," I'm guessing that is because of TV and movies, we get this idea of the way it is shown when reality is somewhat different. Being self deprecating, I'd say a dunces cap suits me well."," I know right! haha, well it was nice talking to you, I've got to fix dinner now. Bye! :)"
237,394,10/5/2021 17:17, Well said! I think it suits me well too haha. That is where the conical party hat was derived from!," Hi, how are you?"
865,395,9/10/2021 14:07, Or maybe we could give it to Mr West next time he wants to speak his mind to us.  ," Great! Did you know that Oscar Isaac requested that his character in The Force Awakens be from Yavin 4, because he's from Guatemala and that's where the Yavin 4 scenes were shot in the original trilogy?"
1191,396,9/23/2021 2:55," Or just when he is walking around being the odd self he is. Anyways, I had a great chat with you, have an awesome day!", I did not know that! I was also shocked to learn that George Lucas's wife won an emmy while he did not.
577,397,9/21/2021 4:53, Do you like wearing hats? It has so many functions!," Huh, he didn't win an Emmy for the Star War Christmas special? Haha. In 2013 Star Wars was the first film to be dubbed into a Native American language -- Navajo. "
1124,398,9/18/2021 7:11, I don't like them on myself but I know a lot of people that can pull them off. , I find it sad that this was not done until 2013. Don't you think it should have been earlier than that?
1300,399,9/11/2021 5:04," Yes me as well. In the military hats denote a nationality, branch of service, rank or regiment."," You would think. It is sad. For the original Star Wars movie, James Earl jones only got paid $7500 and recorded all of his lines in just 2 and a half hours. Talk about a bargain. "
323,400,9/19/2021 17:54, I noticed the different hats in the military but did not know it had to do with rank. , Yeah! That does work out to a great hourly rate though. The total value of the star wars franchise is $65B!
457,401,9/21/2021 0:00," Yes they have a function to play. In the old west, the most popular hat was the bowler!"," And that's after they studio thought it was going to flop, so Lucas gave up his $500k directing fee in return for licensing and merchandising rights. Maybe one of the best business decisions ever made!"
800,402,10/9/2021 4:12, Wow! They always show a stetson or something close so I'm shocked by that. , Yeah! Do you know what he sold to Disney for? How much???
1028,403,10/13/2021 1:35, Yes me as well! Tipping of ones hat arises from the knights raising their face visors. Very chivalry of them!," Seems like it was over a billion. Back to Lucas's wife -- she had a lot of the best ideas for the original movie, like Obi Wan's death. "
1204,404,8/27/2021 17:01, That's a very interesting fact. Did you know that until 1998 British politicians were required to wear a top hat if they were making a point of order?, I cried when I saw that part. Still makes me sad. She also suggested Leia's good luck kiss...
757,405,10/6/2021 18:36, Oh wow that seems kind of an old tradition. Kind of like that conical party hat which was derived from dunce caps!, And re-edited the trench run scene to make it more suspenseful. Those are some big contributions. Much deserving of the editing Oscar. 
294,406,9/30/2021 22:13, That's also a strange hat. As far as old traditions in British politics I don't understand why they still wear powdered wigs in court either. So strange. ," I agree. I think star wars is getting too watered down, with average movies like Solo and New Hope. They were ok movies but not up to the quality we have come to know about the franchise."
334,407,9/19/2021 19:39, Agreed. They look so silly in my opinion. A lot of rapping attire looks silly too. But the rapper Tupac was very talented as his music is in the library of congress of cultural significance., Totally agree. I did LOVE the spin-off Rogue One though from 2016. That one felt like a true Star Wars movie from back i the day. 
1147,408,10/8/2021 8:34," I'm surprised they would include any rap at this point to be honest. Speaking of rap, do you know what Eminem wanted to be before he was a rapper?", I did like that one. I thought that had a good story and nice acting. There's a reason why they are the most successful film merchandising franchise!
1211,409,8/25/2021 3:31, I didn't know that. Very interesting. Rappers also have some odd beliefs. Like Kanye West who thinks AIDS is a man-made disease., Definitely. I also like the diversity of the films. Did you know in the 1950's a judge tried to ban a sci-fi comic because one of the characters was black? Crazy. 
412,410,9/28/2021 10:57, Eminem actually wanted to be a comic book artist. Kanye West is very strange and has a lot of strange ideas. , Very unfair. Isn't (s)he supposed to be just? Weighing the decisions of the land so that everyone is treated fairly?
775,411,9/20/2021 19:31, Yes he is. But he has done some good things like giving a mic to a fan in a wheelchair at his concert.," The 50's were a different time, unfortunately. One of the first sci-fi stories is thought to be from ancient Greece, over 1800 years ago, about plant-based aliens living on the moon."
1063,412,9/15/2021 15:50, That was nice of him. Did you know that Busta Rhymes did voice work in an animated movie?, Who thinks of these stories? I guess it is more of a commentary on my lack of creativity.
1205,413,9/11/2021 23:58, Oh yeah you're right. He was the Reptar Wagon in the 1998 Rugrats Movie!, Haha. Isaac Asimov coined the term Robots in 1941. I'd have thought it was much older than that. 
789,414,9/15/2021 20:32, Yes he was. He has a distinct voice so I don't know how I missed it initially. , Yeah. That seems young. Nice chatting with you!
518,415,9/28/2021 6:36, Good point. I didn't know rap was popular in Korea. They created a form of rap dueling called compliment battle! Well thanks for talking with me today!," hi, did you watch the movie titanic?"
556,416,10/12/2021 18:10, I didn't know that either. That has to sound a lot different than the rap battles here. It was nice talking with you as well. ," Yes, I watched the movie several times and for me it was touching."
1264,417,10/9/2021 15:35, Yes here they are much more agressive! Have a good one!, Yes it always is. did you know the founder of Hershey was going to be in the ship but had to cancel due to work
384,418,9/16/2021 3:40, did you see that Kanye is having another kid?," No, I didn't know that, are you aware if or not the titanic was found in real life?"
91,419,10/6/2021 3:10, I heard something but I'm not really following his offspring :), Yeah and there are even picture of the iceberg that sunk the titanic
907,420,8/23/2021 16:22, I saw that they are using a surrogate and only paying 70k.  I'd want a whole lot more than that!," Leonardo DiCaprio is one of my favorite actor, do you have a favorite actor?"
550,421,9/2/2021 2:24," ok, yes that's what I read... and somebody needs to explain to me, how using a surrogate really works...", I do not think I have a favorite one but he was soo good in the titanic
789,422,8/25/2021 4:06," Simple explanation:  They take egg from mom, Sperm from dad - put it together and then into another person."," If you had to bucket list, what will be number on your bucket list?"
224,423,9/20/2021 22:24, ok... why are they doing that ? Kardashian can't have babies ?, travel the world and explore as many countries as possible . and you?
536,424,9/14/2021 2:44," Not sure to be honest, I'd love to know too though."," About the same travel the world, visit places that I have never visit before, no matter how far."
1188,425,9/21/2021 8:06, I think it's just another thing to do to be on the cover of the magazine and have plenty of interviews...  this is a crazy world... , yeah that would be incredible. d o you like dogs?
743,426,9/13/2021 13:58," I wouldn't doubt it.  Speaking of him, do you like rap music? (trying to cover the topics! haha)"," Yes, I like dogs, I have a german shepard, but I also will like to have a husky if I live in the mountains."
213,427,9/28/2021 8:04," lol ;) no, not really... I don't consider it to be music ;)", That is really nice. they can have one of the 12 types of blood
142,428,9/3/2021 10:59, I mean - I think it is definitely music...but I agree not my type.," Do you have a dog, If yes what breed of dog and his name?"
1328,429,10/11/2021 14:05, Doesn't music needs melody ? ;), I do not unfortunately for now. Maybe later. Dogs can also donate blood that is so cool
693,430,8/23/2021 4:40, Lots of rap does have that!," Wow, that is cool, do you know any of your personal friend's dog that donated blood?"
711,431,9/13/2021 8:51, a sample on keyboard doesn't count ;)," No, none that I know. In Istanbul they have vendin machines that dispense food and water for dogs"
793,432,10/5/2021 13:05, I'm thinking you haven't heard much more than whats on the radio then," Ok, do you like horse, If you do, have you rode a horse before?"
1230,433,9/14/2021 1:49," Maybe You're right, I don't want to argue ;) not my cup of tea though :) I'm more of a blues fan. Classic rock, maybe metal. ;)", I have ridden a horse before and they are my favorite animals. How about you?
1446,434,10/5/2021 0:31, I'll pretty much listen to anything except country.  It is god awful," Yes, I rod a once, I was raised on a farm and all my friends had a horse except me."
701,435,9/20/2021 18:40, I don't listen to country but I don't mind it. It has it's own charm and it takes skills to play and sing country..., THey are such gentle creatures. Nice chatting with you.
1060,436,9/2/2021 18:21, I suppose.  Just like most music what is played on the radio is just garbage , Do you watch the Red Sox? 
1046,437,9/15/2021 10:47, I agree... I mean I haven't heard anything new that's good. Maybe except Black Country Communion... great band," I do, what do you think about Prices injury?"
733,438,9/3/2021 2:19, Can't say I know them!," It sucks that he is injured, a friend of mine had the same problem from typing on the computer."
988,439,10/5/2021 13:21, Do you like rap music?," Yeah I guess carpal tunnel is a pretty common injury, it seems like his problem is related to gaming"
707,440,9/8/2021 13:01," I do, but I cannot tolerate Kanye West. I adore Tupac, and think it's interesting that the Library of Congress chose his music to be included because it's culturally significant."," Yeah, I guess that is better than Tommy John problems. "
1325,441,9/22/2021 10:57," I agree, Kanye's old music was really good. He's just out there. Just like how he thinks AIDS is a man-made disease. "," Well the team manager must be really mad, after all David is one of the key pieces of the team, he said his been playing for a while now, since he was 12 so I wonder if playing games is really the cause"
459,442,10/8/2021 19:50," I just don't care for him. I would have loved to have been in the courtroom, the day a judge decided to give her ruling to Eminem, in rap style."," Yeah, he is a great player. Did you know video games were orignally used by the military? "
243,443,8/31/2021 20:43," That would have been funny. Speaking of Eminem, did you know that his true dream was to become a comic book artist?"," No I didnt, I always thought they were used for entertainment although I know the millitary use them currently"
161,444,10/3/2021 16:19," Yes, Spidey is his favorite. My brother used to love Rugrats when he was little, I only found out recently, that Busta Rhymes voiced the reptar wagon in the movie."," I know, it was probably for some type of war game. "
251,445,9/15/2021 5:20, I didn't know that either. That's pretty interesting. Did you know that Korean rappers invented a new type of freestyle?, What are your thoughts on the name ''Cathode Ray Tube Amusement Devices'' ?
576,446,10/2/2021 10:45," The compliment battle, lol. i would love to hear that. I love how people think the cowboy hat was the most popular in the old west, yet it was really the bowler.", I play them every now and then. LOL
205,447,10/5/2021 18:36," Yeah, cowboy hats were more as working hats weren't they? Did you know that up until 1998 politicians had to wear a top hat if making a point of order in the House of Commons?"," I think its a really long and boring name lol, I do like to play video games as well do you have a PlayStation system?"
1066,448,10/4/2021 19:46," I did not. That sounds interesting. Much like the ""tip of the hat"" originates from Knights raising their visors."," No, I used to though. I didn't like the games that were coming out on it. "
1287,449,8/31/2021 5:05, That is interesting too. I heard that in 1908 a law was passed limiting the length of hatpins.," I see well I bought one and used to play fifa 14, that was the last game that came our for the PlayStation 2 model."
1060,450,9/27/2021 8:30," They did that, so they wouldn't be used as weapons. Smart move.", I used to play that too. Did you Tom Hanks brother does woody's voice in video games? 
9,451,9/11/2021 0:38, Yeah it is. I'd hate to be stabbed to death with a hat pin. ," I didnt, he has a great voice! you know that Stephen Fry is also a game narrator, he narrater the voice for some games"
177,452,8/29/2021 23:24, That does sound like a painful way to die. I do like  the fact that Kanye gave his mic to a fan in a wheelchair once. He does have a few redeeming qualities.," Yeah, I heard that. Apparently playstation 3s are being used to research blackholes. "
899,453,9/4/2021 12:41, Yeah he does have a few. He once did an SNL skit mocking for interrupting awards shows....2 years before the infamous Taylor Swift incident.," Wow it sounds like the consol has a lot of power, it must be cheaper than building a computer capable of doing that, the department of defense also used them to build a supercomputer, in fact 1760 units"
1136,454,9/22/2021 0:13," I have no idea what that is, as I don't pay attention to her either. I still find it mindblowing that Big Sean turned down a scholarship to Michigan, to go rap."," yeah, apparently they used them to build a super computer, I wonder if they were actually playing grand theft auto!"
789,455,9/23/2021 13:09," Yeah that is pretty good. He made a good choice I guess, he's one of the biggest rappers in the world right now. He can always go back. "," I dont about that but something funny happened to the company, they issued and unlock code for the ps3 by accident, they were prosecuting people that did the same things before them."
1360,456,9/20/2021 11:17," Big Sean is? Weird, most have never heard of him. I do like Kanye's middle name, Omari,. "," Wow, did you ever try any of the baseball games on playstation?"
1483,457,9/27/2021 9:29, So his initials are K.O.W. That's funny! ," I did, but I rather watch the games than to play them on a video game console, do you like baseball?"
319,458,9/7/2021 7:55," I love the skits Saturday Night Live does of trump. The one of Brett Kavanaugh was hilarious, have you seen it?"," Yeah, me too. I like baseball a lot, I played when I was younger. "
85,459,9/10/2021 20:02, Yes it was hilarious! , Hello! How are you today?
751,460,9/4/2021 13:55," Thank you for chatting with me, have a nice day."," Hello, I'm great thanks for asking. Do you like video games?"
782,461,9/11/2021 8:00," I enjoyed it, I hope you have a nice day as well. "," I do! I've been playing for over 20 years now, how about you?"
875,462,10/10/2021 18:55, Hello.  Did you know that there is a candy desk in the us senate?, I have been playing for about 25 years now. I saw video games were originally called cathode ray tube amusement devices.
980,463,8/29/2021 5:01," haha yeah, I heard about that. It's been there since 1968.", Say that ten times fast haha. Did you know it is illegal for kids 16 and under to play video games past midnight?
590,464,9/2/2021 21:46, I guess they all like candy a lot!  At least it's american made. The candy is made in pennsylvania.," Haha. I did not know that, but maybe that's a good idea. "
883,465,9/17/2021 5:47, What candy is made in Pennsylvania besides Hershey?, I agree. Do you have a playstation or xbox?
578,466,8/25/2021 17:01," They've got milky way bars, mars bars, and even jelly beans!", I have a PS4. What about you?
811,467,10/9/2021 1:38," Wow, that's way cooler than the fact that they didn't let women wear pants until 1993.", I have an xbox. I wonder when the playstation came out?
890,468,8/25/2021 11:53, I know. It is so surprising to me that it took that long for two women senators to protest by wearing pants on the senate floor., I love Sony so I've always stuck with Playstation.
1088,469,10/11/2021 21:06," They wore pantsuits, they kept it classy. haha.", I had the playstation and playstation 2 but then jumped to xbox. I think it's cool the military uses playstation 3's to build a supercomputer.
45,470,9/14/2021 3:06, Yes they did.  Senate is very big on tradition.  They used the same gavel for 165 years until it got cracked., That is very cool. They are super powerful devices so it makes sense to me.
647,471,9/12/2021 0:15," Senate can be so cool, haha. Did you hear that in 1988 they arrested senators to force them to vote? I thought that sort of things only happened on House of Cards", Do you like to watch baseball at all?
689,472,9/19/2021 16:57, I have heard about that.  One of the senators tried to escape and was carried feet first into the senate chamber by three officers!, I love baseball. What about you?
1443,473,9/29/2021 9:22," Yeah, I think that rule might be from before senators were elected. They weren't elected until 1913.", Same here. I didn't know it was more popular in Japan than it is here!
948,474,10/13/2021 16:56, Elections are a good and a bad thing.  I've heard somewhere that the people of Ancient Athens came to the conclusion that elections would lead to an oligarchy., Me either. It's a huge past time here in America. I'm excited for opening day.
193,475,8/26/2021 14:07, I think that might be because nobody votes. Voter turn out hasn't gone higher than 62% in 100 years., Who do you like to watch?
38,476,8/29/2021 18:43, Maybe some people figure there's no need to vote.  Research shows that the taller candidate wins most of the time anyway., I love the Cincinnati Reds. What about you?
1419,477,10/10/2021 14:08, We should just have people voted in by lottery. That's what Athens used to do.," I'm not a fan of a team but like watching it in general! Anyways, Great chatting with you!"
335,478,9/9/2021 14:00, It almost seems as if that is what we have now.  I think more states than just Nevada show have a none of these candidates on their ballots., I think the same. It was good talking to you too!
819,479,9/18/2021 11:55," Yeah, hopefully we'll see some electoral reform soon, hopefully we can see this will improve fairness.", Have a great day!
1226,480,10/7/2021 15:08, Speaking of fairness did you know that not all men in the UK could vote until 1918?, Hello. Do you play any video games?
480,481,10/3/2021 23:53," nope. But, I did hear that astronauts can vote from space.", I do play games.  I enjoy the call of duty game series.
879,482,9/28/2021 10:09, That is amazing and very determined.  It's like India setting up a booth just so one person can vote in a forest that is full of lions!, I also enjoy that game. Did you know video games were initially called cathode ray tube amusement devices and were used by the military?
334,483,8/26/2021 8:37, Hi are you a fan of Star Wars?," Yes, cathode ray tubes have come and gone and the game plays on.  I have a Playstation 3, but no plans to upgrade.  "
1185,484,10/12/2021 7:41," My son is, so I know a little bit about it.", I have a ps3 as well. I dont see the point to buying a ps4. This one is all I need as well.
152,485,9/11/2021 7:11, Nice!  Did you see the first movie when it came out in 1977?  I remember going to the theater to see it.," The game Destiny turned me off gaming.  It was fun to play, but it demands network connectivity.  Sometimes the old games are just fun.  Donkey Kong and Mario are still OK.  I see Fifa 14 works on PS2, PS3 and PS4."
1179,486,9/15/2021 11:17," No, I did not.  My son went with his friends. Apparently, Star Wars was dubbed in Navajo in 2013.", I was never into soccer games. I liked Madden though. Did you know that ps3s are being used to research black holes.
107,487,10/13/2021 18:49, There must have been a big enough market for them to do that.  They have the money to do it that's for sure.  Just the box office alone the Star Wars franchise has brought in over $8.5 billion dollars!," Yes, people let them run and they network together.  Sort of like the 1760 PS3's used by the department of defense to make a super computer.  Never tried Madden."
1236,488,9/7/2021 14:59, 20th Century Fox did not think that Star Wars was going to succeed.  Do you know what happened to Star Wars' licensing and merchandising rights?, Never played madden. You will have to try it. How about grand theft auto. Have you played that one?
345,489,9/17/2021 21:09, Didn't George Lucas get them somehow?, I do indeed love GTA.  I want to say that I played early rev levels on a PC.  It was a different game back then. FUDGE RIPPLE!  I will search for a disk and see if it is audio.
248,490,10/11/2021 20:06," Yes, because they did not want to pay additional directing fee to Lucas. ", THe original game when played in a cd player would play the soundtrack to the game.
1292,491,8/25/2021 12:32, Nice.  He scored then big time because the entire Star Wars franchise is estimated to $65 billion dollars!, Interesting.  Have you ever had carpel tunnel syndrome brought on by playing games?
155,492,9/4/2021 11:24," 20th Century Fox avoided to pay additional fee of only $500k to Lucas.  They were willing to give the licensing and merchandising to him.  Someone got fired at the company, I'll bet.", Actually I have. I dont know if that is why I got it though. I was typing a lot for work when I got it.
1410,493,8/31/2021 7:37, You know it!  George Lucas' wife Marcia won an academy award for editing the film!," Yes, it can be a big deal.  Imagine a Major League Baseball player missing games because of carpel tunnel.  LOL."
895,494,9/3/2021 9:02," I heard about it.  She was talented.  By the way,  Marcia is no longer married to Lucas.", I can imagine it. It really is painful. Did you know that baseball managers wear a uniform because they are allowed to play if needed?
747,495,9/13/2021 22:21, Whoa!  I didn't know that.  Maybe George doesn't have as much as that $65 billion as I thought.  Yikes.," Haha.  Imagine if your boss could sit in for you at work.  He would be steamed if you said, ""I have a Fortnite related injury and must sit this out."" "
1254,496,9/18/2021 17:00," It's okay.  Marcia is entitled to the money too.  She want the award, remember?", He would be steamed and I would be totally embarrassed. Lol. Did you ever play soccer baseball. That's what Canadians call kickball.
563,497,9/8/2021 20:31, Yes!  lol  James Earl Jones took only 2.5 hours to record all of the parts for Darth Vader for the original movie., Kickball on the playground. What fun.  David Price is the MLB player with a 217 million dollar seven year contract.  Cant play ball games.  Perhaps because of video games. He might try kick ball.
419,498,10/12/2021 17:02," Sorry, what I meant was ""she won the award"". About James Earl Jones - I think he was only paid $7500 for his work.  That was not fair.", Maybe he should. What did you think about that guy findin 3 million dollars worth of old baseball cards in his grandpas attic.
668,499,9/8/2021 10:49, Wow.  That sure doesn't.  I wonder if he gets any licensing fees at all for Darth Vader?  On a different subject....did you know that Earth's surface is 71 percent water and 29 percent land?, Finding 3 million dollars worth is like finding an unlock code for life.
188,500,9/1/2021 22:36, I did not know the exact percentages.  Thanks for the info!, It wouldn't guarantee you win the game but it would sure make it a lot easier. Lol. Have a great day. 
868,501,8/31/2021 12:06, On a sad note relating to those percentages....more than 80 percent of the earths natural forests have already been destroyed?, Have a good day.
107,502,9/14/2021 6:26, I heard about it and we need to do something about it.  , hey there do you watch any shows on Netflix
276,503,10/3/2021 1:38, I agree.  It's sad.  I had a good time chatting with you tonight!," Yes I have a subscription, been watching The Office.  They have come out with their own originals too called Netflix Original.  What about you?"
917,504,9/24/2021 18:43, I thank you for your information - I learned a lot from you.  Have a good night.," oh ya I love stranger things and other shows they have, I do the digital though not with dvds"
369,505,10/10/2021 18:45, Hey! Are you a Star Wars fan? I love George Lucas for creating such a cool storyline.," Oh no I don't do DVDs either just the streaming service.  It's too bad it doesn't have Game of Thrones though, that show has gotten 37 emmy awards."
74,506,9/12/2021 15:12, Hello! I do like Star Wars! I can't believe companies thought it would be a flop!, I do like GOT! George RR Martin is the author and a genius!
544,507,9/21/2021 21:15, Yeah can you believe that? Now the franchise of Star Wars is estimated to be worth $65 billion., It is such a hit parents are naming their kids Arya.  Only a couple more months until the last season starts.
1151,508,8/25/2021 3:20," I'm glad 20th century fox finally decided to jump on board with them! My mind is blown, George Lucas says the entire story is told by r2d2!"," ya I can't wait, weird that charlie Chaplins granddaughter is in the show too!"
1235,509,9/9/2021 17:48, Wow I never knew that. Star Wars is the second highest grossing film series of all time. I wonder what the first one is?," Wonder if they ever offered Tom Cruise a part, he has won so many awards for best actor, they probably can't afford him."
589,510,9/11/2021 6:30, Maybe the Harry Potter movies? I don't think the movie Blade Runner comes close to it haha. Have you seen it?," ya, he is a great actor though, so many classic roles like Maverick in Top gun and Ron Kovic in Born on the Fourth of July"
1124,511,9/2/2021 5:40, Yeah I have seen all the blade runner movies. They are very cool and gritty. Ridley Scott is a good director., Yeah I really like him in The Last Samurai.  He spend time learning Japanese and swordplay on this own to prepare for the role.  Good on him.
50,512,10/4/2021 8:38, I still have yet to see one but I want to! I like how the director and Harrison Ford debated if his character was real or not!," yup I like that movie, I never realized samurai was plural and refers to the whole group and not just Tom Cruise haha"
25,513,9/17/2021 2:45, Now that is something that I have thought a lot about as well. That classic line at the end of the first movie delivered by the replicant was actually improvise by the actor.," I liked him in Rainman too, that movie won Best Picture.  I think one of my favorites is when he plays a hitman in Collateral with Jamie Foxx."
1118,514,10/1/2021 1:14, I think the whole concept of that movie was done right just by hearing about it! I didn't even know the composer to the soundtrack couldn't read music!," oh ya that is a really good movie, he is kind of looney though he spent 10 million dollars to build a bunker to protect himself from aliens"
509,515,9/4/2021 7:38," That is fascinating! Blade runner was the last sci-fi movie to be made completely analog, that is there were no computerized graphics.", Yeah I think he is into Scientology. Did you know he was married to Nicole Kidman? They have since divorced.  Though they did so Eyes Wide Shut together.
865,516,9/10/2021 14:50," Wow, and now it seems like it's all computerized graphics! Speaking of crazy, isn't earth awesome?"," lol, that is a weird movie though, Seinfeld is super rich though, richer than Tom Hanks and Tom Cruise combined apparently "
1,517,9/9/2021 13:59, Yes earth is epic indeed! When earth was first formed a day was only 5.5 hours long! But that was a very long time ago!, Well I am just glad I do not have any stock in MoviePass.  It fell to under a dollar after people found out Christopher Robin was not being shown last summer.
149,518,9/18/2021 9:30, I feel like I would never be able to catch up on sleep during that time lol. I wonder at what point will earth's days be like 40 hours haha.," oh wow ya I'm glad I didn't get that, I just use Netflix and thats enough for me"
1483,519,9/1/2021 10:49, Yeah I've wondered that as well. I don't look forward to working that long! Earth will also be helium free by the end of the 21st-century. No more balloons for us!," Netflix is piling up debt to fund all these new series and shows, 21.9 billion at last count.  But they have made 125+ shows and series of new content."
991,520,9/7/2021 18:55," I wonder if clowns will be out of jobs at that time as well haha. We do have to thank Jupiter though, they save us from many asteroids coming our way!"," ah I didn't know that, they sure take up a lot of bandwidth, about 1/3 of all internet traffic"
933,521,9/11/2021 8:20, Do they really? I'm not really familiar with that concept. One sad statistic is that more than 80% of the earths natural forest have already been destroyed., I bet Blockbuster regrets not buying them for 50 million.  Now they are out of business or pretty close.
183,522,9/17/2021 20:04, That is so sad! We are destroying the planet we live on! That is even more sad because the world is 71 percent water anyways!," ya, with Netflix now worth about 2 billion, that was definitely a mistake!"
985,523,8/30/2021 16:09," Yes it is. Mostly by oceans but also lakes, rivers, and other sources! Well it was lovely getting to talk with you!"," Hello, are you a big Netflix person?"
274,524,9/22/2021 23:27," I agree, It was nice chatting with you as well. Have a great day!", I am!  I have been a subscriber for years and especially love the original content!
978,525,8/27/2021 7:23, You as well. Goodbye now!, I do as well! Were you a subscriber even back when their whole business model was about DVD rental by mail and not an online platform?
1369,526,10/6/2021 6:18," Hello, How are you? Do you like politics?", I was! I think it was in 2007 when they started adding streaming features.
272,527,9/19/2021 18:03," Im well.  I do like politics, I just find our current climate a bit hostile."," It's interesting to think how differently the company could have been if decisions played out differently. Like Blockbuster declining to buy them many times, and now they're worth many times over."
664,528,8/31/2021 14:26," lol, I agree with you!! I didn't know Nevada is the only state to have a none of the above voting option?", Exactly! A purchase of $50 million that is now worth $2 billion. That is just CRAZY!
451,529,10/8/2021 11:01, I think that is a perfect option.  Sometimes there just arent good candidates., And I feel like that doesn't even big to desribe how huge Netflix is still. Netflix accounts for a third of ALL bandwith in North America from 9pm to 12 am!
280,530,9/20/2021 22:29, I agree!! Did you know since 1900 the taller candidate has won by 75%?," Which is honestly just nuts. And when you combine Netflix and youtube, it's half of the peak internet traffic in North America alone!"
887,531,9/5/2021 3:11," yeah, I guess people think dominance with height?  Not sure how that one works.  And All bearded presdients were republican"," I was surprised to learn recently though, that despite how huge their online platform is, they still do DVD rentals! And spend 20 times more on postage than their bandwith."
855,532,10/12/2021 14:51," Yes, I heard that too! Good to know the astronauts in space can vote too!", True - but I think they might need to start paying more attention to what they are spending - they racked up $21.9 billion in debt as of Sept 2017 trying to get content!
596,533,10/8/2021 8:47," They can.  And in certain places they might have voted for some animals.  Like a cat named Hank, third place in Virginia senate election"," That's certainly a lot of money! Although at least it's an investment and will come back to them. On the other hand, I remember a decade ago, Tom Cruise spent $10 million on an underground bunker to protect himself from aliens, what a nut."
432,534,9/10/2021 0:43, Oh my goodness! Really. At least we don't have to go into the forest with lions like they do in Indian government!," I stopped liking him when he went all about Scientology. I much prefer other actors now, like Peter Dinklage."
184,535,9/2/2021 18:33," I know, id be skipping out on that election."," I've never heard of him, does he do a lot of action movies? I like Tom Cruise because of movies like Top Gun and Cocktail but I'm always interested in expanding my preferences."
962,536,10/13/2021 2:12, I think I would too! Too bad Richard Nixon cracked that 165 year old gavel the senate used. It must be somewhere on display.," Actually, Peter Dinklage plays Tyrion Lannister on Game of Thrones! "
499,537,8/26/2021 22:06," Yeah, that has to be a piece of US history."," Oh wow! That's a beautiful show I've been meaning to watch, it's filmed in Ireland I think! And from the limited parts I've seen the scenery is gorgeous."
21,538,8/24/2021 8:51, Love the candy desk idea at the senate! Now I'm going to think about them going thru that drawer full of milky ways . mars bars and jelly beans!, Yes. It is my most favorite show - which it definitely has earned with all of its Emmys - 47 to be exact! 
47,539,8/24/2021 11:44, It does sound like the best idea ever.  All that candy is made in Pennsylvania too.," That's a whole lot! They're certainly influential, I read somewhere that Arya is the fastest rising baby name for girls in the US, due to a character from the Game of Thrones."
805,540,9/18/2021 21:20," Yes, keep their sugar levels up!! lol"," My daughter is named Arya. So we definitely fell into the trend! I am sad it is going to end this year, with the last season starting in April."
231,541,9/2/2021 15:19, Keep them working.  LOL," Oh wow that's very cool! Hey at least if you ever want to pick up a new show after, Nat Geo Wild has a show that parodies Game of Thrones but follows lions!"
1013,542,8/25/2021 5:25," Yeah, can't make good choices when your sugar has dropped!  It can't believe it took until 1993 for women to wear pants on the senate floor. ", I heard about that! I think that would be awesome - following them like the characters in the show!
608,543,9/12/2021 6:18," I know.  If I were elected, I would be doing that first day.  Actually, Id probably bring up senate pajama day.  I m all about the comfort."," Yeah absolutely, regardless it will be cool to see if Netflix can makea similar show themselves after Game of Thrones ends. Anyways it was nice chatting with you, have a good day!"
925,544,9/26/2021 0:32, I am too. Nothing worse than trying to work and feeling uncomfortable!! Good chat!!," Hello, do you watch Netflix?"
1461,545,9/18/2021 3:30, For real!  Have a good one!," Hi there, I do sometimes, but don't have an account myself.  How about you?"
164,546,9/22/2021 19:05, You too! Have a good night!!," I do have an account. Did you know from 9pm-12am, Netflix accounts for 33% of all the bandwidth in North America?"
1451,547,9/24/2021 0:08, Do you know much about politics?," Holy cow, that is so much bandwidth during those peak hours. "
1180,548,10/3/2021 6:33, Just the basics mostly.  Do you know what the 'candy desk' tradition is about?, I agree. Netflix and YouTube make up half of the peak internet traffic in North America.
54,549,9/24/2021 15:53," I've heard one of the Senators keeps candy in their desk. Pretty cool! Did you know that Since 1900, the taller candidate has won the us presidential election 75% of the time?"," That is crazy, and I think it will even continue to grow in the future. "
1004,550,9/5/2021 18:59," What! No, I did not know that, that is very interesting. ", Netflix is worth $2 billion right now.
1476,551,9/1/2021 9:26," Also, Astronauts vote from space, so the rest of us have no excuse not to make it to an election. "," Wow, I think back in 2000, they proposed to Blockbuster that it should use Netflix as it's online service, they laughed at the offer. "
1380,552,9/24/2021 21:16," That is crazy, but understandable.  And you are right, gives us no excuse.  Did you know about Jordan's political dealings?", I bet lol. Netflix was started due to a $40 late fee incurred by Reed Hastings.
1388,553,9/10/2021 20:20, I don't. Tell me more.," Yeah old Reed didn't like those late fees, look what happened since then. "
218,554,9/23/2021 21:00," He was asked why he would endorse a Democrat, and he said because republicans buy shoes too.  I thought it was funny. ", Do you like Tom Cruise?
609,555,8/28/2021 4:15," Haha, that is funny! Nevada is the only state to have a ""none of these candidates"" voting option for presidential elections."," Yeah I do, I really like 80's Tom Cruise movies.  How about you?"
224,556,10/4/2021 6:38, Yeah I think the Nevada voting laws are quite odd.  , Me too. I love Top Gun.
1131,557,9/10/2021 6:56, The voter turnout for us presidential elections hasn't breached 62.8% in the last 100 years! That's actually more than I would guess. ," Yeah Top Gun was one of his best for sure, I always like risky business. "
688,558,9/7/2021 9:59," Well, we'll see how voting will be done twenty years from now, if they make it easier, the numbers will probably rise. ", Tom Cruise once threatened Tom Kruse who is the inventory of the hoverboard.
648,559,9/9/2021 9:14, That's true. Not all men in the uk had the right to vote until 1918., I heard that!  I think he should have just endorsed it and gone along with it.
1426,560,10/10/2021 5:24, I wonder how much fraud there was in voting back in 1918. , I agree. Tom Cruise spent two years learning Japanese and swordplay in preparation for a film.
525,561,9/27/2021 15:14," I'm sure a lot. Elections are fairly new. rom 1789 until 1913, Senators were appointed by legislatures of the states they represented; following the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913, they are now popularly elected. "," That is dedication, I have always admired him for his acting skills. "
1239,562,10/5/2021 9:32, That is a very interesting fact.  Do you remember the first time you voted? , Me too. He has a $10 million dollar underground bunker to protect himself from aliens.
859,563,10/5/2021 9:26, I don't. it was a long time ago! Women were not allowed to wear pants on the u.s. senate floor until 1993. ," That is the weird side of him, I remember when he went kind of nuts on the Ellen show years back. "
641,564,8/24/2021 12:53, I think that is the strangest fact of the day.  I think it's wild when observers have to be blocked from polls during elections. , It was great chatting.
437,565,9/9/2021 13:04, Strange and freaky! dian government sets up a polling booth in a forest full of lions for a single voter., Did you know the china wall was very large and famous in the world.
890,566,9/21/2021 12:32, I think I've read that before! Wild to think about. , I did know that. I think I saw a movie about that on Netflix actually. Do you have Netflix
962,567,9/24/2021 15:54, Nice chatting with you. Thanks!," Yes, i have Netflix. Netflix was founded in 1997."
660,568,10/13/2021 14:40," Hey how are you, can't believe that Georgia senator got arrested!", Yep it's crazy that they're going to spend it 2 billion dollars this year to make more new content. I do like their shows though
179,569,10/13/2021 22:35, She said she was peacefully chanting., Netflix tv shows are awesome. And Netflix founder was reed hastings and marc.
160,570,9/3/2021 19:32," That's interesting, I wish voting was different now, no reason to still have ballots with no federal holiday for Election Day.", Yep he started it because he was mad about the late fee for his movie Apollo 13 haha that is actually really good movie have you ever seen it
797,571,9/23/2021 11:05, It's interesting that astronauts vote from space! , I saw that movie. I think the movie was released in 1970.
1209,572,9/24/2021 22:37," For sure, I wonder if it's confidential up there? How does it get back to earth?", I think it was actually in the nineties I think you're thinking of the wrong one haha. Apollo 13 head Tom Hanks in it. What do you think about Tom Cruise though
787,573,9/2/2021 21:10," Right, I'll have to look that up. Indian government sets up a polling booth in a  forest that is full of lions for just one voter.", I love tom cruise and his movies. It was awesome. mission impossible movie was so great.
1449,574,9/16/2021 8:01," I wonder if that person even shows up to vote, or why he's in the jungle like that haha. Did you vote last election?", Yep I like Mission Impossible II. I also like The Color of Money in the movie Cocktail. Eyes Wide Shut was pretty weird though haha
73,575,9/2/2021 19:54," Yes I did. And even though we don't have to go to a forest full of lions, voter turnout for US presidential elections has not reached 62.8 percent in the last 100 years.", tom cruise edge of tomorrow movie was awesome. edge of tomorrow directer has a great mind.
1470,576,9/21/2021 0:34," That's crazy, I wonder if they'll ever fix that, plenty of things they can do about that but never attempt it. ", It's crazy that Tom Cruise spent two years learning Japanese and how to use a samurai sword to prepare for the movie The Last Samurai. Personally I didn't really like that movie what did you think
1409,577,9/23/2021 7:13, Since 1900 the taller candidate has won the US presidential election. Hope that's just a coincidence!, Tom cruise was great actor and hard worker. He spend a lot of to learn a japanese language.
696,578,9/8/2021 13:01," Oh wow, that's pretty crazy. I'm 6'4"", I should run for president lol. "," Yeah for sure. I also never knew that in the movie, The Last Samurai, Samurai is actually plural and refers to Tom Cruise and the whole clan"
606,579,10/5/2021 20:17," Ha, maybe you should. Officials in Athens didn't have much faith in elections. They thought it would lead to oligarchy.", I think the movie was released in 2003 and the movie was successfully crossed 45-68 crores usd.
253,580,9/1/2021 6:12," Oh wow, that's some forward thinking. What is an oligarchy again?"," I always think the Tom Cruise is super rich, but Seinfeld has a net worth that is more than Tom Cruise and Tom Hanks combined which is insane"
41,581,10/8/2021 4:18, It is where power is concentrated in a small group of people., Tom hanks also great actor and his net work is $390 million.
1495,582,10/8/2021 10:29," Ah I gotcha, they're kind of right I'm sure. I wonder what the perfect government system is? Any ideas?", He has a great actor. Tom Cruise is kind of a weird guy though. He spent $10 on a bunker to protect himself from outer space aliens
711,583,8/24/2021 18:07," Not sure I have faith in any, as all great civilizations come to an end. It seems like we are still barely progressing though. Women could not wear pants in the US senate floor until 1993 after a couple of women senators protested by wearing pantsuits.", It's great but i don't know.
1005,584,9/25/2021 0:22," Oh wow, that's crazy how sexist they still were. I agree about the great civilizations coming to an end, they all thought they'd be around forever too."," Do you ever watch Game of Thrones? I love that show, it has won a bunch of awards"
428,585,10/12/2021 2:56," I think it's interesting that astronauts vote from space. Yet, we have low turnouts for presidential elections for those of us on earth, haha.", I watch all 7 seasons. it's all are good.
414,586,10/10/2021 1:54," For sure, I wonder why people don't show up so much, I wish they would more!", Yeah I love them. And I didn't know that Arya is the fastest growing baby girl name in the United States period that is definitely due to Game of Thrones
942,587,9/7/2021 20:16," Yeah, the Indian government set up a polling booth in a forest full of lions for one voter, that is pretty neat.", good morning to you
2,588,9/20/2021 10:01," Very cool. Great chatting with you, I'm going to take off though, take care!", Good morning! Are a fan of The Simpsons? Fox News once tried to sue to get the show to stop parodying them. 
185,589,9/20/2021 3:11, did you watch the movie Frozen?," I love the Simpsons! not so much Fox news though, they deserve to parodied"
815,590,10/10/2021 13:24," I did and loved it so much, and you?"," They practically ARE a parody! Do you remember their version of the Daily show from 2007? Man, it was terrible. Really, really terrible. It was canceled after 13 episodes. "
1277,591,9/27/2021 17:16, me too. Did you know it is the first movie by disney directed by a woman?, with Jon Stewart? the one on Comedy Central?
63,592,9/18/2021 23:34," Yes and also that it made $1 billion worklwide, that is amazing"," Yeah, fox tried to copy it with their own show called the Half Hour News Hour. "
1302,593,9/5/2021 5:53, I know. Elsa was the main villain in the original script of the movie, oh I thought you were saying The Daily Show was bad and got cancelled! yea Fox should not have copied that show. Did you know Fox News and IGN are owned by the same company?
293,594,8/25/2021 8:54, Yes but the let it go song was too uplifting to keep her as the villain, I did not know that. But I'm sure Rupert Murdoch owns dozens of companies I don't know about. Another thing I didn't know -- Hillary Clinton was the president of the You ng Republicans in college. 
114,595,9/19/2021 13:01, Yes. And the original title of the movie was the Snow Queen," wow! her views sure have shifted a lot since then, huh/"
635,596,9/14/2021 17:31," Yes but they changed it because feminine titles do not seem to do well, so sad"," I'd say. Nixon actually proposed a guaranteed minimum wage, the only president to ever do so. "
398,597,9/12/2021 5:41, That is sad and it is just the mentality that we have to work hard to change," which surprises me , I always thought that that was something that pretty much everyone had touched upon in their time in office at least a little bit"
256,598,9/14/2021 9:24, Yup agreed. They also changed Rapunzel to Tangled for that same reason," Yeah, I was surprised too. Another surprising fact: Tea Party/GOP poster child Ayn Rand was on Social Security and Medicare. "
903,599,9/23/2021 5:50, Yeah. DO you have a pet?," wow. I never cared for her books, did you?"
573,600,9/23/2021 3:39, I have two cats and a dog. DO you like dogs?, No. Couldn't even finish the one I started. Canada's first official currency was playing cards! Now that's cool. 
494,601,10/6/2021 20:47, I love dogs. did you there they can have one of the 12 blood types?, sometimes i wish they still used stuff like that! id be rich! haha
1144,602,9/29/2021 18:19, Yes and there are blood drives for dogs," Haha. Hawaii passed single payer healthcare in 2009, but the governor wouldn't sign it into law. If only the rest of the country would follow suit - and then pass it into law. "
989,603,9/2/2021 2:40, So cool. In istanbul they have installed water and food dispensers for dogs," yea I wish we had single payer, my health insurance is so complicated sometimes. people shouldnt go broke over a doctor visit"
777,604,9/13/2021 11:54, Yes and all you have to do is feed it plastic bottles," Totally agree. It's ridiculous that we don't haver it in this country. Someday, I think. Hopefully. "
125,605,9/26/2021 16:04, Yes such a genius idea and it helps everyone involved, Some candidates are pushing for it! sadly those guys dont win office
490,606,10/8/2021 0:46, I know. Dogs are really good at understanding pointing," Yeah. In Kentucky, you can't take office if you've ever participated in a duel. Maybe that's what we need more of in politics today -- duels. "
625,607,9/23/2021 16:56, Yes and same goes for the elephants as well, imagine that? haha duels in court would be hilarious 
3,608,9/22/2021 22:11, Yeah. Google is a dog company it seems, Do you like Taylor Swift?
861,609,9/13/2021 7:42," Yes they have that in their code of conduct, talk about dedication", I liked her country stuff and some of her earlier pop. How about you?
1473,610,8/27/2021 13:58," I know right, dogs deserve that though"," I do like her, specially her performance of the Reputation tour she had in Glendale. AZ"
1062,611,9/8/2021 2:28, Do you like baseball ?, It seems like she and Kanye West have perpetual conflicts of one sort or the other.  First he crashed her award acceptance.  Then she is accused of stealing his music.  Social media was not kind to her over that accusation!
983,612,9/26/2021 19:06, I have heard of it. Do you?," I think they were a bit unfair to her, it must be hard to be a celebrity, specially a really famous one like her"
363,613,10/3/2021 8:35," I like, the sport but there is not MLB team in my city, so I don't watch it. But I find it really interesting, full of small details, like managers wear a uniform so they could replace a player if they need to. "," Well, they called her a ""snake"".  I like the way she turned it into a positive in her concert with imagery, a snake microphone, and a snake platform.  Snakes in general have an unwarranted bad reputation.  Do you have any experience with snakes?"
835,614,10/11/2021 12:49," That is probably a holdover from the old days when a player was chosen to be manager. Nowadays, it wouldn't work."," No not really, but I love them many people are scared of them but I think they are interesting animals"
1344,615,9/10/2021 23:43," Yes, I wonder if it could be even dangerous for some of them, like some could have an heart attack.  "," I live in a rural area, so snakes are not uncommon.  I have a 4-5 foot common garter snake nesting at the base of my fig trees.  I like there because she eats the field mice and other critters who want my figs.  Too many people automatically assume snakes are poisonous.  Did you know that only in Australia do venomous snakes outnumber non-venomous ones?"
1118,616,9/3/2021 11:46," Yeah, no insurance company would touch the managers on the field, that's for sure."," I didnt know that about Australia, are you afraid of snakes? with what you told me previously I bet you are not afraid of them"
1201,617,9/26/2021 8:50," I think they would be better at softball, did you ever watch a softball game ? "," No.  I let them go on their way and I go one mine.  While we do have coral snakes, water moccasins, rattle snakes, I have never been bitten.  Did you know that one man has been bitten so often that the antigens in his blood allow it to be used an anti-venom?"
686,618,8/24/2021 3:56," I have never watched a softball game, though I understand many women play it. "," Really? I guess he made a valuable contribution to science and also to medicine, did you hear of that species of flying snakes"
649,619,9/8/2021 2:18," I think it is more a hobby than a professional sport, the average salary is around 5500 $ per year, some hobos make more. "," I had not, but I could see it possible to approximate flying.  I know they can climb trees because I see the garter snake in my fig trees.  I guess if she wanted to, she could coil and spring, flinging herself from one tree to another.  Down here, Mardi Gras ended last night.   My ears are still ringing from the concerts put on by local bands.  Did you know that a Fighter Concert was so loud that it was picked up on New Zealand seismic (earthquake) monitors?"
302,620,9/26/2021 22:39," Hobos? I never thought of income in terms of hobos, though I guess they do make money through their illicit means. "," I didnt know that, do you have any favorite bands? used to like Linking Park"
609,621,10/12/2021 7:32," Panhandling can be quite profitable, for someone with no income. Like in a busy place as Manhattan. But even if I don't consider softball as a legitimate pro sport, if was the first event televised on ESPN.   "," When I lived in Viginia, I liked Dave Matthews when he was starting out in Charlottesville.  Did you know that a woman driving to a Dave Matthews concert picked up a stranded bicyclist who was Dave Matthews himself!"
388,622,8/30/2021 13:52, Can you win money through betting though? That always legitimizes a sport.," Wow, that is amazing, I mean what are the ods, that woman is really lucky, I bet she went crazy in that moment."
382,623,10/4/2021 11:52," Yes, if it is your criteria, then video game is a legitimate sport. They have leagues and a lot of betting is done on matches. "," I would think so.  I have not been to an major act indoor concert since my high school and college days in the 1970s and the 1980s.  Back then Deep Purple broke the record for the loudest concert ever that rendered 3 people unconscious.  While rendering 3 people unconscious is alarming, I wonder how many people had lifelong hearing damage after that one?"
851,624,9/18/2021 12:31," Their is a physicality to what they do, but it's just in the hands."," I bet at least a few of them did, a really bad concert was the one the band Creed gave in 2002, the concert was so bad the band even got sued by some of the concert goers"
1145,625,9/9/2021 2:01," As shooting, and it is even an Olympic sport, but it is strange to see a smoking fat man winning a medal. Do you play video games ?"," Well, Creed survived that one to become a major rock act in the early 2000s.  Do you know if Taylor Swift is still on the ""Reputation"" concert tour or has that wrapped up?"
1290,626,8/24/2021 16:52, I used to play video games. Not much now. Lost interest. Do you? ," I guess its all wrapped up by now, I think this article is a bit old, I think that tour happened around 2016 so yeah."
277,627,9/3/2021 8:39," Me too, I have lost interest playing before I have lost interest in buy them so I have a backlog of a few games that reminds me  not to buy the next console. It is the more and more popular, 3 billon hours are played on video games each week on Earth. "," I glad her reputation survived from the Kanye West feud.  While I not much of a fan of her current music, she is a talented artist.  She also is quite a philanthropist.  Did you know she donated all proceeds from ""Wildest Dream"" song to African wildlife conservation?"
352,628,8/31/2021 1:10, Wow. So much time on games. I guess it's about the same as time spent watching TV.," No, I didn't know about that, seems like she has a great great, I will follow her example from now on, anyways it's been cool to chat, thanks for all the facts and knowledge"
861,629,10/7/2021 19:21," Yes, but video are viewed more negatively than TV, that is why you have legislation in some countries limiting the time played by children."," Well, its time to start cycling to work.  Nice chatting with you."
1286,630,8/26/2021 11:46, It is important to keep the kids from losing themselves in the games. Which countries restrict video games?," That will do some favors to the enviroment for sure, nice chatting, have a nice day. "
1464,631,10/1/2021 20:33," There is Korea limiting kids under 16, and China I think. Mostly Asian countries. ", Do you like snakes?
135,632,9/2/2021 5:02," The kids there go nuts over games. I know that there are pro gamers in Korea. Anyway, fun chat!"," they are kind of gross to me, but do you like them?"
28,633,10/9/2021 6:50," You too, have a good evening."," Yeah there history is strange. Apparently there is a lizard with no legs and i always though that was what a snake was, lol. "
1275,634,9/16/2021 13:38, Hi there are you a baseball fan?," really? I wonder what separates the two from each other then, i have to imagine they look very similar"
1284,635,10/9/2021 16:18, i like baseball. i usually watch the world series. You?," You would think but that's not what they pay me for, ha. Maybe we should move to new zealand they don't have snakes there."
754,636,10/6/2021 7:55, I'm a fan.  Did you know that baseball managers wear uniforms because they are technically able to play for their teams if needed.," i agree, snakes are so creepy, they are a very lucky country in my opinion"
532,637,9/23/2021 17:14, I think that is a holdover from the old days. i bet back then a player was chosen to also be manager., Mine too. Apparently fear of snakes is hard wired into our brains and monkeys.
1285,638,10/5/2021 15:35, I'm not sure how that worked.  The last one to do that I remember was Pete Rose back in the late 80's.  He played every day and managed at the same time., maybe it is because of the way that they move or the noises that they make? I cannot think of why that may be the case
1423,639,10/11/2021 18:48," yeah, he was a competitive guy. probably perfect for the dual role of manager/player.", Me either. Do you know who Taylor Swift is? 
178,640,9/5/2021 13:42, Up until 2005 a married couple scheduled all 2430 major league baseball games played each year for 24 years!  I bet that could get confusing.," I do, I am a big fan of her music!"
258,641,9/27/2021 16:34," Yeah, i figured that was all done by computer.  I guess they had a pretty sweet gig.", she was born on December 13 1989. one of her albums won 4 grammy's. 
1171,642,9/25/2021 8:28, Must have paid pretty good otherwise I don't think they would have done it for that long.  A man found 3 million dollars worth of baseball cards in grandfathers attic that were hidden since the 1940's.  He hit the jackpot.," she is very successful, she also owns a private jet, she is doing very well for herself"
534,643,9/11/2021 23:03," Wow. I would probably sell some, and keep the rest as an investment. What would you do?", Yes she is and to be so young it's great! that jet is a Falcon 900 and cost 40 million right? Those are really nice.
856,644,9/13/2021 15:53, I would do exactly the same as you.  How could you not pass that up the chance to set yourself up for life? lol," yes, that is more than I will see in my lifetime, but I am glad she was able to make so much in her career before she loses popularity"
1372,645,8/29/2021 22:11," Yeah, that is quite lucky. Do you follow softball at all?", Well hopefully she did well with the money she made so far because fame don't last forever. 
133,646,8/25/2021 16:53, I actually enjoy watching college softball on ESPNU!," that is true, she knows her stuff, she took her music off spotify so it was not free, she is kind of money minded"
1283,647,9/3/2021 22:33, Really? the womens game? do men play as well?," Well that's good. Apparently she accidentally released 8 seconds of white noise and topped Canadian itunes charts, lol."
567,648,9/18/2021 17:55," lol I watch the women though because the pitchers really sling that ball to the plate.  On May 11, 1991 Creighton hosted Utah in the longest softball game in NCAA history lasting 31 innings!"," that is insane, just imagine being that popular, most people never even see that much success"
1057,649,10/8/2021 4:39," Yeah, that underhand pitch can really move. That is one long game! Not much of a career after college though. As of 2014, the average salary for a professional softball player is between $5,000 and $6,000.", Right! Her walking backward to avoid picture taking is a ;little weird though. 
743,650,9/1/2021 11:10, No.  Not enough fans to support it. lol  Jose Canseco claims to hold the record for longest softball homerun at 622 feet.  He might have it.  I've watched him hitting softballs on youtube.  He crushes them even still to this day.," i guess i sort of get that, it must be annoying being public so often"
315,651,10/7/2021 13:49, He had the juice to hit the balls a country mile. I didnt know he played softball. , I can't even imagine. Nice chatting with you!
1478,652,9/23/2021 7:00, Check it out on youtube.  I was shocked at how far the balls go. lol  Kickball is also called soccer-baseball in Canada! lol It's been fun chatting!," Where do you source your news? Fox, Cnn, other?"
1024,653,9/26/2021 16:42," Yes, it has been fun chatting! Have a good weekend!", Mostly other. Certainly not Fox. 
706,654,9/3/2021 22:27, You have a great weekend too!, Did you know that CNN recently raised concern about Fox & Friends?
451,655,10/12/2021 18:30," Hi, how are you doing this fine evening?", I had heard something about it. Weren't they concerned about their interviews with Republicans?
349,656,10/13/2021 21:53, Hey there I'm doing great. What did you think about the Disney movie Frozen?," Yes you are correct. Despite the students mourning due to a mass shooting a day earlier, Republicans appeared only a fox where they wouldn't be pressed about gun control"
360,657,9/12/2021 22:49," I haven't seen it. Is it a good film? It's animated, right? With lots of songs?", That's terrible. All of our press should be able to question our representatives. I think some of the people they interviewed were Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz if I remember correctly. 
1184,658,9/18/2021 10:01," Yes it uses computer animation and it has love songs. It was super popular. There's a song that all the little kids were saying called""Let It Go and I guess it's based on the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale called the snow queen", All they mentioned was that it was a truly heart breaking horror and that evil is sadly always present.
575,659,8/29/2021 9:02, HC wrote so many great stories. I read the Snow Queen a long time ago. I don't remember it.Has the movie won any awards?, We should have known it's bias since it was created by a Republican media strategist and Richard Nixon. 
482,660,9/23/2021 22:52," I'm pretty sure that it has, I know that it made a ton of money. Apparently the villain used to sing that song I mentioned, Let It Go, but the song was so happy that they changed the character", I feel that most news are bias in some way or another. Too bad fox is watched more than cnn and msnbc combined.
1168,661,10/12/2021 12:16, that's good thinkg. I bet the song is up for an award somewhere. Who were the people involved in the film?, That's sad. Apparently they even threatened to sue the Simpsons for making fun of them for their anti-democratic agenda. They wanted to stop them from continuing that. 
536,662,10/4/2021 17:01," There's like a princess, a reindeer and a snowman, they're like them three most important characters. Also this is the first movie that was produced by Walt Disney and directed by a woman.", I mean usually its kind of funny how they threatened to sue the Simpsons over a fact which is true. I guess their perspective is a given since they were created by Richard ailes and president Richard nixon.
437,663,8/29/2021 9:32, Not many films get directed by woman. That's good that she got the job. Good for Disney! They know how to spot talent., I agree. They would never win because of parody laws anyway. Did you know that every US president with a beard has been a Republican?! How odd. 
546,664,9/15/2021 8:48, I think so. Apparently she was the first female director of a film that earned over 1 billion dollars too. So that is another record that she set, It seems like a strange coincidence? 
721,665,8/24/2021 11:30," Disney has won a ton of awards, and I'm sure she'll win awards as well."," Ha ha. Maybe. Unsurprisingly, there has not been a president that was not a democrat or republican since 1853. "
157,666,10/10/2021 6:40, Oh I'm Sure. Do you like dogs by the way? We used to have a husky ourselves, Well I believe either Roosevelt or JFK came very close as a uncorrelated 3rd party.
958,667,9/26/2021 23:34," A dog is a great friend, but no, I have never had a dog. I enjoy playing with them though.", You may be correct. I was floored to learn that the last time until very recently that a Republican president was elected without a Nixon or Bush on the ticket was 1928!
954,668,10/4/2021 0:32," Dogs are awesome, I think anyway, they have like 12 different blood types and apparently there are dog blood drives that exist"," Wow! I didn't know the extent to which the Nixons and Bushs were so influential. I also recently found out that the colors of red and blue associated with republicans and democrats was a recent change, only starting in 2000. I wonder if they used any other colors before then?"
120,669,9/28/2021 20:17, I wonder how the dogs are rewarded at the drive. People get cookies and orange juice., That is a good question. I would have thought it had been that way for a longer time period than that. Did you know that Truman visited Disneyland and would not be photographed on the Dumbo ride so he wasn't associated with Republicans. 
318,670,9/24/2021 17:53, I know right? I hope that the dogs get a treat at least haha. Did you know that Istanbul has vending machines that reward stray dogs for bringing back trash?," Well for politicians image is everything. At least at some level of politics, the US has been quite progressive. For instance, Texas' first elected female governor came into office even before some states ratified the 19th amendment"
381,671,9/9/2021 6:36, The Turks know the value of recycling and that dogs are keen to help for reward.," Wow, I would not have thought that, especially with it being such a conservative state. I was sad when I learned that only one governor was against the internment of Japanese citizens during WWII. "
1458,672,9/14/2021 20:43, Oh for sure! One other thing I didn't know is that dogs and elephants are the only animals that respond to pointing. I want a pet elephant haha!," I understand the difficulties of a country given it is a melting pot and it can't let spies cause problems in WWII due to conflicting loyalties, but they didn't execute this process well and treated Americans of Japanese heritage unfairly. It is too bad only 1 governor was against their imprisonment. "
686,673,10/13/2021 14:58, Good luck with that elephant! Anyway I enjoyed chatting with you!, I agree. What a horrible blight on our history.
131,674,9/7/2021 9:33, I enjoyed chatting with you as well! And yes I'll go to local pet store and see if they have elephants in stock haha, Did you know that the Beatles song Come Together was written for Timothy Leary? 
316,675,9/8/2021 6:17, Have a good night," No I did not, but it wouldn't surprise me since Leary's research was about the use of psychedelic drugs."
1012,676,9/3/2021 19:58," Thanks you too! And watch out for dogs, they're not actually colorblind but they just don't see as many colors as a normal human can"," Yeah, I remember that, he was pretty out there, right? "
338,677,9/19/2021 2:55," Ana Gloria Henrequez was from Salvador, trying to get to USA, trying to escape from misery and gangs in El Salvador. She was caught."," Yeah, he wrote about every drug under the sun haha. Although, a lot of recent evidence has proven some of his theories correct"
87,678,9/3/2021 3:53," Yeah, I heard about that. I feel horrible for her young daughter", Like which ones? I'm not familiar with a lot of them. 
330,679,9/22/2021 23:30," Sorry, Ana Gloria Henrequez is the grandmother, my bad. Ximena is the girl and the mother is Cindy. They said that they never had been caught until Trump's laws."," I think like ecstasy, mushrooms, and LSD, pretty much a lot of the stuff that the government bans."
286,680,10/4/2021 7:17," Yeah, I'm not sure if that actually made any difference. It just really sucks that even after his executive order ending the separation reuniting families is still so difficult"," OMG, I read about that. Did you know that in 1934 North Dakota's governor declared martial law? "
59,681,9/9/2021 20:17," Yes, I know. I don't know how they are not keeping track of what child belongs to what mother. It's terrible to know that the kids were heard wailing and asking for their family members."," That's crazy, do you know for what exactly?"
548,682,8/31/2021 1:00," It's even crazier that the grandmother could recognize Ximena's voice. I guess since I've never been a parent, I can't comprehend that", I'm not sure. But I know that texas elected their first female governor before some states even ratified the 19th amendment. 
743,683,9/11/2021 0:12, You are right. Nobody knows how a parent feels until you are one. Is terrible. I myself I was thinking that I would prefer stay in my country and don't enter the USA at least while they are taking these measures. It would be terrible to lose my son or grandkid.," Yeah, and it's crazy that Texas used to be a blue state until the 1980s, then it turned very red haha"
1225,684,9/9/2021 2:14, I understand that. I can also understand wanting to leave when there are gang members on every corner and your little one is just starting school," Interesting, like the ground turned red? Or you mean politics? "
383,685,9/17/2021 22:31," Yes, I understand that. It has to be very, very difficult, a terrible decision to make. But, me, personally, I would prefer to face it together than not know what happened to them. I don't know, this is a very difficult situation."," No, like in politics. It used to be mostly democratic. More interestingly, the ""blue"" and ""red"" colors tow denote the two parties weren't legitimately used until 2000. "
580,686,9/29/2021 22:06," Plus, she had to leave her dog behind :( Poor little Cookie"," Oh, so like a long time ago Democrats were pro slavery I think. Wasn't Honest Abe a republican? "
396,687,8/24/2021 18:11," Yes, this is such a terrible story. Well, Cindy was robbed twice on the bus. That makes it very difficult to live in a place where you don't have any safety."," Yeah, he was. The parties have flip flopped so much throughout US history. But on a lighter note, every president who has had a beard has been Republican, which is really crazy."
145,688,8/25/2021 9:09, I watched an episode of a TV show Shameless recently and it showed an immigrant child separated from his parents in Texas who ended up in foster care in Chicago!," I'm not sure if that is true, sadly I don't know a lot about politics, so I can't call that out if it is wrong. "
1096,689,10/11/2021 5:57, I wonder why people are adopting them. Praying for them. Have you seen Frozen?, I'm somewhat interested in politics but they just make me depressed.
554,690,9/17/2021 18:50, Many are adopting the kids because they want to give them safe homes!," Nah, I think it is at its best now. Most entertainment in years. "
116,691,10/3/2021 18:35," Oh, then, thank you very much. Glad to know about this. God bless them. Well, I liked a lot Frozen. Is a fiery Princess.", Haha that's so true
844,692,9/14/2021 6:01," yes, it was great movie. And there's a sequel coming out. I can't wait!"," You know there hasn't been a US president who hasn't been a republican or democrat since 1853, who was it? "
547,693,9/22/2021 3:42," Hahaha, liked the graphics, tooo!  Do you like dogs? I didn't know that among dogs they have 12 different blood types!!!!!!!", I think they were in the Whig Party. But I don't the president. Tyler maybe?
719,694,9/26/2021 20:05," Yes, and they even have doggy blood drives ^_^ Did the male love interest have a dog or a horse in Frozen? I can't remember...", Do you own a pet snake?
1302,695,9/8/2021 8:15," Really, me either. I have a bad memory for some things. lol, but I think I will never forget that Minnie Mouse's name is really Minerva.", No but there are some snakes outside around where I live at.
1181,696,9/17/2021 22:30," Really?! Like the Greek goddess? That's fascinating to me. Usually Disney tries to ""de-feminize"" things rather than feminize them more. Frozen was supposed to be named Snow Queen but boys often don't see movies that have feminine nouns in the title :/", They are considered legless lizards. I like lizards but not snakes
353,697,10/1/2021 14:57," hahahaah that is so much male, lol. Nice to meet you, giving to you an excellent, have a nice day!", What is your favorite type of lizard?
1019,698,9/2/2021 4:49, Have a lovely day as well :), Iguana by far. I almost bought a baby one yesterday. I was looking at Chameleons too
95,699,9/25/2021 2:58," Hello my Friend?! Are you a fan of ""Frozen"" the movie? I personally Looooved it!", Would you ever consider owning a larger one like a crocodile?
1120,700,8/28/2021 22:41, I have not seen the movie. Is it animated? Is it for kids?," Heck no. They are illegal too, aren't they?"
475,701,9/24/2021 21:48," both! lol, although Im not a kid so I guess for all haha, I did take my kids to see the movie though. It came out in 2013 and earned over 1 billion dollars", Oh I didn't realize they were illegal to own.
1037,702,9/23/2021 2:19," That's great! I must be a wonderful film. It's a disney film, yes? Lots of songs?"," They are more closely related to birds and I only like parrots for birds, and the bald eagle of course"
1415,703,9/5/2021 22:46," That is correct! produced by Walt Disney Animated Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures. It was so cute! They also remade Rapunzel as Tangled, have you seen that?", Do you like Taylor Swift?
270,704,8/24/2021 16:09, I have not. I guess the story is basically the same as the fairy tale? Girl with long hair in a tower?," I do, kinda. I like her as a person. She seems humble and very likeable"
1061,705,9/27/2021 23:16," Yes, another of my favorites! How about you? What do you like to watch?"," Yea, she also walks backwards around paparazzi."
233,706,9/22/2021 20:26," I enjoy watching comedies and dramas. I sometimes watch animated stuff, but not usually.", She was born and raised close to where I grew up in Pennslyvania too
834,707,9/4/2021 11:29," Me too, Mysteries or psychological thrillers are great, but animated is one of my favs to watch with kiddos although everyone knows Minnie mouse did you know minnie is short for minerva?! mind blown", Do you know about the Tennessee state?
1435,708,10/11/2021 18:07," I did not know that. I'm not surprised that Disney makes about $1,110 per second. That's a lot, but reflects the success of the brand.", Not too much. How about you?
689,709,10/1/2021 12:15, Oh my! thats awesome! I guess im not too surprised since the company was founded in 1923!," Yes, I know more than most would about the state. There are some big snakes there."
713,710,10/6/2021 3:47, Almost 100 years old. The Mouse House will soon have a century behind it., What kind of snakes are common to Tennessee? Rattlers? Bull snakes?
1224,711,9/19/2021 17:08," Wow, well its maintained its popularity very well! I mean there is a whole subculture dedicated to finding hidden mickey mouse images in all things disney", I think it's them rattlers!
1231,712,9/15/2021 11:34," I've never looked for the hidden images, but I imagine they are there! It's part of the playful nature of the company. It wants to create many layers of fun for the viewers."," I had a bull snake in my yard last year, a big one too."
79,713,9/27/2021 7:13," Yes, and thus I'm not surprised they're so succesful. That's very creative and engaging, and keeps viewers interested and coming back... genius!", What happened?
98,714,9/17/2021 8:07, It's ironic that Walt Disney was fired from his job at a local newspaper in Missouri for ''not being creative enough.'' I guess his genius was not recognized because he was ahead of his time., I let him be and just watched him slither through my backyard
517,715,9/18/2021 22:11," Wow! well see, that's why I believe in perfect timing sometimes there are better opportunities ahead of us. amazing! ", Was it a big one?
862,716,8/28/2021 23:24, Are you interested in dogs? They are quite clever. Dogs can learn over a thousand words and  reason better than chimps., It appeared as so to me. I stayed far away from him because of how big he was.
1063,717,9/27/2021 22:36, Yes! I sometimes Love them better than people... they are just full of Love. Did you know there are 12 different blood types that a dog may have and dog can donate blood at dog blood drives! I love them even more!, Did you ever about them snake whistling people?
608,718,10/13/2021 17:00, That's great! They also have 'eureka moments' and enjoy the experience of solving a problem  to obtain a reward. Much like people!, I don't understand the question.
1220,719,9/25/2021 21:19," Yes and they understand by pointing! How cool is that? Thats how I get my dog to get my slippers! Anyway, fun chatting with you! Namaste :)", Hi!  Do you watch the news?
938,720,8/25/2021 2:11, Have a good evening!, Yes I love watching the news. How about you?
390,721,9/11/2021 6:11, you too," I love the information, but everything these days is so slanted from both sides sometimes it is hard to get."
1419,722,8/29/2021 16:27," I have never heard of Fanfest,"," Right there is not one source out there that you can trust. I hate the news outlets, but still need to see what's going on."
395,723,10/4/2021 2:32, Hey! What is FanFest? lol, Much agreed.  I find that the truth lies somewhere in the middle.  The media tries to create outrage for their ratings.
414,724,9/11/2021 1:58," I guess its where the hall of famers meet, At first I thought it said hall of farmers, lol", Exactly. That's why I watch both CNN and Fox. It kind of helps me to sort through the muck.
1267,725,10/9/2021 10:26, Ok. I honestly never heard of. Do you play video games?, Fox is watched more than Cnn and MSNBC combined.  Kinda crazy to think that.
1208,726,9/8/2021 1:01," No, But I did not know they were first designed for the military", I think Fox is slightly more honest than the other two.
1400,727,8/26/2021 7:53, It could be for training purpose. I'm wondering why Australia has more banned games than China... It means some US games also banned... It's quite strange. , Fox news threatened to sue the simpsons over their constant parody.
1253,728,10/7/2021 5:49, it is like kids in korea being banned playing games after 12, I didn't know that. I don't watch the Simpsons. I know CNN is whining because they can't get any conservative guests. Why would you want to go on their show and be abused.
400,729,9/14/2021 4:59," after or before 12? If after 12, why is it so? I used to play a lot when I was child. I'm not surprised that video games make more money abbually than all films from Hollywood.", Why would a liberal news network want a conservative guest?
1016,730,10/5/2021 5:30, But would you categorize them as an art form?, I think so that they can attempt to make them look like a liar or a fool or whatever negative thing they can think of.
1460,731,9/9/2021 1:30, Interesting question. I don't think this is any sort of art. It could be kind of sport. I more support this point of view. How about you? What's your opinion?, That is true. Did you hear about that time in 1957 when Truman refused to be photographed with Dumbo
883,732,8/26/2021 4:44," I really not did get into them, But I would consider them an art form", No I didn't. That's funny. Maybe Dumbo wasn't crazy about the idea either.
344,733,9/1/2021 3:40," It could be. At the same time it would be easy to define popularity of such art. For example, it could be a reason why the rating system was involved in video games.", Yeah.  Maybe they should have brought Eeyore out
769,734,10/10/2021 1:54," Maybe I will just go to the fanfest and try the Pitching tunnels, can you throw well"," Okay you've got me there, who's Eeyore."
459,735,9/7/2021 12:34, Ok. Do you watch or play any sport? Like softball or baseball?, He is the Donkey from winnie the pooh.
438,736,9/2/2021 1:13," I only play have you heard of any of these players like, Davey Johnson?", Okay now I understand. He'd make a good mascot for the Demos.
1329,737,9/21/2021 21:50," Yes. He played in 1970s, right? Or maybe 1960s... I don't remember.", Definitely.  Did you know the red and blue colors started being used in 2000?
113,738,8/28/2021 6:20," I have no clue, But I love the name Rollie Fingers.", No I had no idea. Did you know that every president with a beard has been a Republican?
393,739,9/14/2021 15:01," Baseball is fun to watch. I like it. However, I always have difficulties to hit a ball hahaha "," I heard that.  I wonder how many presidents had beards, I know lincoln, but who else?"
531,740,9/11/2021 5:21, maybe you should go to the show you can get a medal Maybe, I can't think of any. I can't imagine someone getting elected today who even has a mustache.
383,741,9/29/2021 17:41, Medal would be too much significant achievement. The Chicago Cubs were the first to win back-to-back world series and haven't won since. My luck is about the same lol, Very true.  Haha.  Great chat!
190,742,9/14/2021 6:43, Thank you for your time but I must go now, Good morning! Do you know anything about snakes? I saw a huge one on reddit the other day!
792,743,9/1/2021 15:24, Have a good day! Thanks.," I know that they are elongated and legless reptiles covered in scales. Furthermore, they have highly mobile jaws and usually fangs for venom."
1068,744,8/30/2021 11:21, bye, That's true. My husband pulled one out of my garden. I had never seen it before. It's a rat snake. I guess they are good for killing pests.
1203,745,9/27/2021 20:31, bye!, I think rat snakes aren't poisonous? Did you know that the fear of snakes are wired into human brains? I guess people who hate snakes should live in new Zealand since there aren't any there.
268,746,9/23/2021 10:39, Hey how are you? Did you see the FanFest in Miami last year by chance?," Nope, rat snakes aren't poisonous. They are actually a good kind. I have always believed no snakes should exist, so I believe we are wired for it!"
916,747,8/30/2021 9:00," No I didn't see that. It's interesting that 23 former Nationals attended it though, did you see it?", I wonder what differentiates snakes from legless lizards?
1398,748,9/16/2021 7:21," Yah, it was pretty cool. I didn't catch who the olympic gold medalists were, did you? They said there were two of them there.", That is a good question. Maybe that lizards have eyelids and some snakes dont. 
1104,749,8/29/2021 10:20," No I didn't catch their names. But I know that a lot of gold medalist attended as well as some people from the US Olympic softball team, I don't watch sports or the Olympics so I can't say that I know any of the names LOL"," That makes sense. Personally, I don't mind snakes, although I am wary since venom can be quite potent and dangerous. As long as they aren't flying snakes that can launch themselves at prey are around my area and I can spot them well a head of time, I'm okay."
749,750,10/7/2021 3:16," Me neither, I wish I knew more about the olympians, they're so elite. Hard for them to get a lot of recognition though. You play video games by chance?", flying snakes? My worst nightmare!!
585,751,10/10/2021 1:40," Yes I play video games somewhat, used to play Maurice a kid but I don't play that many these days. What about you? I'm just glad that I didn't grow up in South Korea because apparently playing a video game after midnight if your under 16 is illegal"," I guess New Zealand would be ideal for you, with no snakes and all"
407,752,10/2/2021 0:37," Oh wow, I would have never of guessed that. I played a lot of video games growing up, I think there is a lot of benefit to them. I play Fortnite now, and I'm in my 30s lol. Do you still play?", True! Do you ever Listen to Taylor Swift?
687,753,10/4/2021 20:10, LOL I have heard of the game but I have never played it. I do know that they did a study and apparently as a planet we play about 3 billion hours of video games a week so I definitely should be playing more perhaps haha," I have heard bits hear and there and recently read some articles, but I am not completely familiar."
607,754,9/21/2021 4:26," I could definitely see that. What were your favorite video games? Jane McGongiai was the game designer behind that study, pretty cool.", She writes a lot of her music about herself. Very popular singer. Who do you listen to?
1083,755,10/5/2021 12:08," Well I really liked the Nintendo 64 and I also like the original Xbox, it's interesting that I played a Toy Story game back in the day and it wasn't actually Tom Hanks who did the voice but his brother Jim Hanks"," Well I do know Kanye did a self mocking skit 2 years before the infamous Taylor swift incident. Other than that, she is among the worlds contemporary artists."
1196,756,9/8/2021 0:16," Wow, I'm surprised they have such similar voices. I went the Sega to Playstation route, still rocking the PS4, no Toy Story game though.", And she owns a private jet!
526,757,9/14/2021 9:53, Yeah the PlayStation 4 is cool. I'm just glad that we called him video games and not their original name which was the cathode ray tube Amusement device LOL, I recently learn she once accidentally released several seconds of white noise and it somehow topped the Canadian itunes chart.
1088,758,10/1/2021 22:39," I like video game a lot more than Cathode Ray Tube Amusement Devices lol, dang military always overcomplicating things.", That is funny! But she also thinks music should not be free. I disagree there. I should be able to listen to it all I want.
316,759,8/30/2021 21:21," I agree with you. Did you ever play the video game LittleBigPlanet or Harry Potter? Apparently the same person did the narration in both of those video games, his name is Stephen Fry"," Well for artists, royalties are a lot part of their revenue, even for moderate artists."
1205,760,9/18/2021 13:21, Stephen Fry from Top Gear?, Thats true I suppose. Do you know Swift walks backwards so she wont have her pic taken?
1124,761,8/25/2021 17:22," I'm not sure if it's the same guy, I don't know Top Gear personally, but it could be, do you ever play softball by the way or watch it on TV?", Wouldn't walking backwards make her stick out more?
920,762,9/11/2021 20:25," I hear Stephen Fry's name all the time, he must be super famous in the UK. I don't, you going to spit some softball knowledge my way?", I would think. Do you listen to Linkin park at all? they played 324 concerts in 2001.
96,763,9/30/2021 11:44," Haha yes I can do that. It's interesting that the softball is bigger than a baseball because it is about 12 in in circumference, I've never played softball but that seems like a really big ball lol"," Unfortunately, I have never listened to Linkin park. However, I have listened to The Ramones and they played a total of 2,263 concerts."
573,764,9/14/2021 2:32," Yah, it's quite a bit larger than a baseball for sure, I've never seen a softball video game though, have you?", Wow! I was always a big Pink Floyd fan myself. They played in an empty roman amphitheater once. 
896,765,9/11/2021 11:31," No I've never seen one actually. It's interesting though that the average salary for a professional softball player is at most $6,000 LOL definitely you're not retiring on that money", Were they recording a music video? Or did they just do it for fun? A ancient roman amphitheater sounds amazing
1266,766,9/4/2021 19:15," Oh wow, definitely not! Anyways, I am going to get going, great chatting with you, take care and have a great night!", I think they did a video there. Thats why there was no audience! The ramones did a lot of concerts. How long did they tour?
107,767,9/8/2021 10:13," Yes it's been an excellent chat! And make sure to try out a baseball video game once in awhile, they are actually pretty fun", I believe they toured for 20 years!. Anyway I think I will check out Linkin park. Thank you for the chat.
1011,768,9/15/2021 13:09," Hi, how are you?", Do you watch the news?
728,769,10/5/2021 7:16, Good! You?  Are you into Fiction at all?, A few times a day.  
404,770,9/27/2021 3:07, A little and I prefer non-fiction. Do you like it?," Me too, what do you think about Fox news? Apparently they are watched more than msnbc and cnn combined."
1039,771,9/30/2021 16:00," I read mainly non fiction too,  but I can get in to some of it. I think it is cool that there is a wiki that ranks fictional characters according to their powers.", They are biased and pro republicans. It is okay though.  Free speech is always good.
1261,772,10/1/2021 17:48," I find that useful too! Edgar allen poe wrote about a cyborg, the oldest example of it.", Yeah your right. Fox was created by republican media strategist and a former president. 
851,773,9/28/2021 5:14," Wow, that is kind of neat.  I thought that was a more modern invention.", Richard Allies and former President Nixon created the fox news.
172,774,10/2/2021 21:20, Me too. Julius Ceasar wrote fan fiction too!, The Two Richards that's right..haha!
1343,775,10/11/2021 13:27, Wow.  Id like to see what came out of his mind!," Yes,it was funny.  Do you know that Foxnews tried to sue the Simpsons?"
443,776,9/1/2021 21:41, I guess it was about Hercules and Oedipus. George RR MArtin would not have liked that!, I heard they were trying to silence a parody of anti-democratic party agenda.
324,777,10/9/2021 20:34," Yeah, he things it is copyright infringement.  I dont exactly agree with that."," Yes, you are right.  They want it to stop the Simpsons from parodying its anti democratic party agenda."
81,778,9/12/2021 15:31, I don't either. Imagine being the racist judge who tried to ban a comic book because of a black guy in it., They also discussed creating a channel that would only play the Simpsons.
381,779,10/7/2021 12:50, That is really kind of ridiculous.  I cant even believe that happens.," Yes, I heard about it."
991,780,9/30/2021 4:08, I know. I cannot believe people want to upload their minds to computers!, Not sure what they hoped to accomplish since the Simpson's were never going to stop clowning them. 
521,781,9/11/2021 14:00, That is odd.  I dont want my innermost thoughts to be displayed anywhere.  ," They own the Simpsons, right?  Why were they against them since the simpsons have been generating money for them for years?"
998,782,9/17/2021 22:38, There's a reason I buried my skeletons deep! I wonder if it runs on water like the Russians did in 1936?, Good question! They also owe IGN the gaming website. Do you game?
1184,783,9/27/2021 15:27," Yeah, that is pretty fascinating.  I wonder why we arent exploring that technology more.", No I do not but I'm aware of the fact.
876,784,10/5/2021 16:21, They were too busy building a 16-bit computer using minecraft blocks!, Ok. On a different note did you know that when Arnold Schwarzenegger was governor he did not live in Sacramento but instead commuted everyday by jet for three hours?
1428,785,9/9/2021 23:02, I cant believe that was even possible.  I thought minecraft was just a game.  That is crazy, I did not know that.  Do you know that the republican party is also referred to as GOP.  Arnold is a republican.
185,786,9/12/2021 12:39, Right? I wonder who built it too? I wish my son could do that stuff. But not smoking. Smoking near an apple computer voids the warranty.," Yup! Speaking of governors, did you know that Ralph Lawrence Carr was the only one to opposed Japanese American interment camps during WW2."
1353,787,8/26/2021 1:00," Good thing I never smoked near mine.  They think it makes it a ""biohazard""", I heard about it.  Good for him.  Those Japanese people were American.
775,788,9/20/2021 10:05, Agreed! Nice chatting with you!," They were, so sad. Texas elected it's first female governor. "
1311,789,9/6/2021 23:20," hey there, do you go out and vote during elections?", She was the second female governor in the US.
1408,790,9/30/2021 7:16," Hello there, I do like to get out and vote, how about you?"," Your right, nice chatting with you. "
427,791,9/5/2021 7:57, me too. do you know way back then though how people were appointed in ancient athens?," Hello, do you ever watch Fox News?"
1449,792,8/27/2021 7:33, I guess they were appointed by a lottery of some type.  I think they believed that elections would lead to an oligarchy. , I usually don't watch it. I understand that it's popular.
286,793,9/17/2021 14:45, I wonder how that would work today though., Fox discussed the possibility of creating a cable channel that would only air the Simpsons.
485,794,9/6/2021 16:36," Yeah I don't think that would work very well, but then again, maybe it would work better, who knows. "," That is an idea that might work, but now I figure people are on the Internet. Maybe a YouTube channel?"
656,795,10/6/2021 17:58, yeah there is no knowing there. In Nevada they have a none of these candidate options in the ballot., Possibly...The gaming website IGN is actually owned by Fox News.
379,796,8/28/2021 12:59, Yeah I heard that there were some wild results in the Nevada elections this year. ," Oh, I didn't know that. I guess Fox owns a lot of things out there. A gaming site? Hm."
271,797,10/10/2021 1:47, I did not know about that one. not a lot of people seems to vote though since less than 63 people go out and vote, Yea very interesting. Fox News is watched more than CNN and MSNBC combined.
370,798,9/27/2021 14:29," Isn't that pretty sad, I guess it hasn't breached that 63% barrier in the last 100 years!"," I believe it. CNN has its own bias, as does MSNBC. People watch what they want to believe."
1122,799,9/4/2021 8:00, yes it is because it is a right and we are not using it to its best.," Yep, not a huge fan of CNN because they post so much fake news and are very biased."
1040,800,9/16/2021 2:56, That is true.  Did you know that the taller candidate has won the presidential election 75% of the time?, I don't watch CNN. What kind of fake news?
943,801,9/21/2021 16:11, hahaa I really wonder if that has any correlation with how people perceive the candidates, They just report things that are fake or swayed to the liberal spectrum of politics. Fox News was created by Richard Ailes and Richard Nixon.
75,802,10/5/2021 9:37," Yeah I guess it must, because that is just way too high to just be chance. "," The viewership of Fox skews pretty old. In 2015, the median viewer age was 68 years old. Older people tend to be more conservative."
659,803,10/10/2021 8:26, did you hear that international electoral observers were blocked from polls in nine states in 2012, That is very old. Did you know there hasn't been a president who wasn't a rep or dem since 1853?
76,804,8/28/2021 16:35," No I didn't hear that, I wonder why they stopped doing that? "," The two party system is frustrating because the choices are limited. The money backs certainly candidates, and there is little possibility for outsiders to get in."
998,805,9/25/2021 10:13," maybe they did not trust them, i have no idea. do you know when republicans and democrats started using red and blue?", I agree. Every president with a beard has always been a republican.
978,806,10/10/2021 17:12," No I don't, but probably more than 100 years ago or so, do you know?", I guess that imparts a look of sage wisdom and manliness.  
472,807,9/5/2021 14:25, It was actually as recently as 2000 so not very long ago., I guess so lol. The last time a republican was elected president without a Nixon or Bush on the ticket was back in 1928.
47,808,10/1/2021 18:09," Really, wow I am really bad at politics I guess.  ", That's quite a while. I guess Trump might be starting a new dynasty. Will his daughter run? Who knows.
1238,809,9/7/2021 12:20, I did not know it either until now. It was nice chatting with you., Haha possibly. Who knows what will happen next.
343,810,9/30/2021 19:21, Poetry is an art that is getting forgotten," I would like to see some change in gov't. Sometimes old ideas have value. The only president to propose a guaranteed minimum income was a republican, Nixon.. I think that people are worried now and would like some security."
195,811,9/6/2021 11:52," It is one of those that I feel like I don't always understand, but love to hear the analysis of and see how deep it can get.  For instance, there is a poem where if you read it one way it's sad, but read it in reverse and it's actually inspirational!", Me too. It was good talking to you.
364,812,9/29/2021 20:15," Wow, I bet that poem required a lot creativity, wrtting a poem with completely different meanings, oposing genres, genius", Are you familiar with Native American books?
1105,813,10/4/2021 4:00," There is one guy that wrote a poem of over 220 words in palindrome (where it is the same backwards and forwards -- like ""nurses run"")!", I read a few in school.  I was raised in Oklahoma and many of my friends were of the Cherokee and Choctaw tribes.  I have heard of Tommy Orange's fiction novel about Native Americans.
635,814,8/26/2021 20:39," Sounds really hard, did you ever read one of Edgar Allan Poe's poems?", That's interesting!  He is a member of the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes.  I don't know much about those two tribes.  His book is about a boy?
962,815,10/9/2021 14:56," I think I read a couple.  I feel like I know them so well because of horror and Halloween stories.  I know ""The Raven"" was pretty popular.  Do you think he made a lot of money with that poem?", Yes.  It is fiction however.  It provides insight into the challenges that the boy has in grappling with his identity.  We have a national history where many atrocities and slurs dot the history.
1400,816,9/24/2021 4:23," Not really in fact he only made $9 for the publication of that poem, seems really underpaid", True!  I went to an indian reservation this past summer in New York.  It was the Seneca nation and I went through one of their museums.  They pretty much got kicked out of their land just like all the other tribes in the nation.
866,817,9/2/2021 6:31, Wow!  That is crazy!  I hope he had a good day job.  Maybe just regular fiction works would have been better financially.," A people divided into tribes cannot stand against a unified enemy.  But, my wife's best friend has a Ph.D. and the government paid for all of her education because she is Cherokee.  But if one knows the facts, a lot of interesting history can be written."
1246,818,9/27/2021 21:33," I hope he did as well, the raven is like his most popular poem and selling it for $9, business was slow, he also wrote cyborg fiction,", Wow.  That's really interesting.  Hopefully Tommy Orange's book does well.  
636,819,9/30/2021 5:06, That's pretty cool.  If he'd had a black character in it in the 1950s that was worthy of banning a science fiction comic!, Books can be fiction with a lot of facts or not so many.  Wiki has an article where they rank fictional characters according to their powers.
1308,820,8/27/2021 2:12," That sounds really racist, theres a wiki rank of fictional characters according to power and abilities,  I wonder who is the strongest hero", Julius Caesar wrote fan fiction in his youth.  Never knew that he did that before.
197,821,10/8/2021 16:22," Maybe like a Superman type or Hercules?  Funny thing, future emperor Julius Caesar actually wrote Hercules based fan fiction when he was younger.  I wonder what that was like.", I wonder how one would find a copy of it.  Imagine Edgar Allen Poe wrote about a cyborg a long time ago
699,822,10/5/2021 21:58," I bet it was pretty good, it was about Hercules and Oedipus, I wonder if he was good.", Interesting!  A judget ried to ban a science fiction comic in the 1950's because it featured a black character. 
610,823,9/19/2021 11:02," Game of Thrones author, George RR Martin, might not have cared for it.  Maybe Caesar would get a pass, but Martin doesn't care for fan fiction at all!"," Wow!  We have come a long way, thank goodness.  The FDA also burned 6 tons of literature in an act of censorship."
100,824,8/27/2021 18:20," Yeah I heard he hated fan fiction, he doesnt care about it at all so changing the subject a bit do you use computers a lot?", I think I remember reading about that before.  Literature was an olympic event from 1912 to 1952.  I would like to see one of those gold medals.
303,825,9/24/2021 12:05," It seems like that is what I do the vast majority of my day.  I'm not ready to upload my mind to a computer or memory stick like transhumanists, but it is like an extension of me some days."," I would like to understand the scoring.  I bet it was somewhat like Jeopardy.  I would also like to read the ""best"" of the ""worst opening sentences"" that people used to enter into a contest."
176,826,9/16/2021 3:17," I agree theres so much we dont understand about the human mind, Transhumanist must be missing key elements of the human essence.", lol  That would be interesting.  Didn't Sir Winston Churchill win a nobel prize for literature?
1368,827,9/7/2021 1:13," Are you a PC or a Mac?  Be warned that being a smoker an an apple computer user could actually void the warranty as they see it as a biohazard if someone smokes by it.  I am neither, but that's beside the point."," That would not be my first guess, but I think you are right!   Based on literature, kissing is a fairly recent development."
1082,828,9/30/2021 0:17," I have a mac and I dont smoke but its good  to know, seems kind of random to void a warranty because of that, ", You would think that would have been written about a long time ago.  Switching gears ... id you know that Apple had a clothing line in 1986?
293,829,10/8/2021 16:59," Maybe they should have tried to make a water-based computer, which apparently the Russians were able to make in 1936.  I do wonder what sort of ""computer"" that was though.", People did not wear brands on clothing so prominently as they do today back in 1986.  So that was Apple being innovative in another field.
1239,830,9/23/2021 0:52," I wonder if they still make computers that ran on water, not sure is the best idea to mix water with tech"," Surprisingly, the Pilgrims wore clothing that was full of color and they only wore black for special occasions.  I'm so used to seeing them stereotyped wearing black and white."
1136,831,9/23/2021 21:44, Do you like to use computers? , Me too.  You know that every human society has worn clothes.
1098,832,10/6/2021 10:13, Yes I love computers. I can't imagine my life without one. In 1936 the Russians made one that ran on water.," I would hope so.  lol  I guess it depends on your body type, etc."
1420,833,9/1/2021 15:29," Interesting. If you think about it, a lot of power comes from water. "," I suppose if the weather is perfect, a grass skirt might be enough, but it is still clothing.  Clothing is often gender specific.  Nice talking."
1295,834,9/10/2021 6:41, Yes such as hydropower. Apple computer's seem to be quite sensitive because if you smoke near an Apple Computer it voids the warranty.," Are you a fan of books?  I personally read a lot, mostly non-fiction though."
1417,835,9/4/2021 17:41," Interesting. That doesn't sound true, but I wonder if it is the same for the iphone?", I don't really have time to read but when I do I like to read fiction. I find it funny that Julius Caesar wrote fan fiction of Greek mythology.
798,836,8/28/2021 22:18, I don't know what you mean? There is a group called transhumanist's that want to upload their minds to computers and memory sticks!," That is sort of odd.  There is even a wiki that ranks fictional characters by their powers, that would be an interesting read."
84,837,9/5/2021 21:16," That sounds pretty cool. I would do it, would you? ", And in Greek literature there wasn't much kissing. Romantic kissing is actually a recent development.
610,838,9/26/2021 4:42, I don't know sounds kind of creepy to me! Almost like the work of fiction! Like something from someones imagination!," That surprises me, I  guess I always associated it with all love stories.  Even Shakespeare."
418,839,10/7/2021 19:41, I think it would be pretty cool. Do you play minecraft? , Yeah I think there was a lot of romance just kissing wasn't part of it.
425,840,9/11/2021 22:04, I have in the past. Kind of amazing someone built a working computer using only the mine craft building blocks.," I see.  Winston Churchill won a Nobel Prize, for literature.  I always though it was for peace"
932,841,9/22/2021 22:42," Yeah, that is pretty crazy. I'm not even sure how that is possible? ", Interesting! Literature was an olympic event from 1912 to 1952. I always associate the olympics with sports!
602,842,9/11/2021 7:16, Me neither. I also don't know how the space shuttles general-purpose computer runs on 1 Mb of RAM.," Same here, I always thought it was part of the ancient games but never made its way to the modern games.  How do you even judge that?"
337,843,8/30/2021 23:54, I'm not sure either. It seems like a small amount of ram. ," Yeah, pretty subjective. Speaking of literature contests, there isone that challenges writers to come up with the worst opening sentence for a novel."
1252,844,9/14/2021 19:01, Yes it does. Do you like reading fiction? I kind of like reading things that are not based on history or facts.," I heard there was, I wonder what the winners were, those would be fun to read."
1291,845,9/15/2021 14:28, I'm not a huge fan of fiction. Did you know there is a wiki that ranks fictional characters based on powers? , Do you think that literature should be censored?
587,846,9/1/2021 12:17, I would like to see that. Edgar Allan Poe wrote the oldest known example of cyborgs in fiction., Absolutely not!  That is why I hated to hear that the FDA burned 6 tons of literature
451,847,8/25/2021 16:00, That would be pretty cool. I wonder what the best fictional character is on the wiki? , But should fan fiction be allowed? George RR Martin says it is copyright infringement and isn't useful for aspiring writers.
731,848,10/10/2021 20:41, Yes I bet superman is up there. Probably Thor too. Julius Caesar wrote fan fiction of Hercules in his youth. He definitely got started early., i think so.  I think it is a great creative outlet for pepole.
585,849,10/10/2021 5:57, Superman definitely has to be up there if not number one. Well nice chatting with you!," Have you heard of Tommy Orange's debut novel, There There?"
1361,850,8/27/2021 5:17, A judge in the 1950s tried to ban a work of science fiction because it featured a black character. Glad times have changed. Nice talking to you too!," i havenr, whats is it like?"
670,851,9/14/2021 17:13, Nice chatting with you too!, It is about Native Americans in modern history but seems to also touch on how they were treated in the past. It's a fictional story with elements of truth.
885,852,9/21/2021 9:40, Hi and good afternoon. Are you a poetry fan? It has a long history dating back to prehistoric times., I think that might be an interesting read.
148,853,8/31/2021 9:16," Hi, how are you? i am not a big fan of poetry. Are you?"," The story follows around different members of a large cast of Native Americans who live in Oakland, CA. I'm not sure if I would like it because I like books that focus on one character."
264,854,8/27/2021 21:11, I think it's fun to read sometimes. The origins are more interesting for me. Early poems in the Eurasian content evolved from folksongs. , I can take several focuses as long as I can put together what is going on.
1484,855,10/13/2021 4:01, I dont much about poetry. that is interesting. i guess poetry and songs would be closely related.," That's good! Some of the people speak directly to us and others use the third person, so there are diverse approaches. "
98,856,9/23/2021 15:45," Yes I suppose they would. They tried to define poetry in ancient Greece such as Aristotle's poetics. It focused on the use of speech in rhetoric, drama, song, and comedy."," It has been good chatting tonight, but my dinner is ready, and I must go.  I have a great night."
164,857,8/23/2021 12:42," I guess poetry is spoken and written, so it is related to many arts. Do you have a favorite poet?", Have a good night.
1461,858,10/8/2021 3:15, I think it's funny when comedians do poetry. I don't really have a favorite poet. Demetri Martin wrote a 224 word palindrome!, I've been reading a lot of interesting stories these past few days.
839,859,9/19/2021 6:16," that must have taken him quite a while. 224 words, backwards and forwards? my head hurts.", Really? what have you been reading lately?
910,860,10/3/2021 2:45, Yes mine hurts just thinking about it. Edgar Allan Poe is another classic poet and he only received $9 for the publication of his poem the Raven.," A few different fiction stories, very interesting. One was Tommy Orange's debut novel."
888,861,9/8/2021 21:45," He probably spent it on drugs and booze too. the man was so decadent, but maybe it inspired him."," I heard about that one, its the one with the little native american boy right?"
300,862,9/30/2021 21:34, Yeah you probably did. I love the hobbit too. Most of the character names were taken out of an old Icelandic poem called dvergatal., Yes! It was quite an emotional read. It made me really think about how life is like for them.
510,863,9/6/2021 0:28," Yes, Tolkien loved old languages. he studied them and learned to speak some of them. "," Native Americans suffered for a lot of years, its a story that involves a lot of blood and tears and not an easy story to tell"
550,864,9/9/2021 3:03," That is so fascinating, I love his works of fiction. I like fiction because it is so imaginative. What is your favorite genre?"," Definitely! Orange did a great job w how he shared their history... It was quite diff from the 2nd book I read. A Visit From The Goon Squad, familiar?"
478,865,10/10/2021 19:04, I like non fiction because i want to keep up with what is going on in the world. ," I heard that book was pretty good as well, kind of dark though, "
639,866,10/9/2021 15:02, That's good and definitely practical. The author of game of thrones despises fan fiction because he says it is copyright infringement and not a good exercise for aspiring writers. I kind of see where he's coming from.," For sure, there were some powerful tales. I found the sory about the man born with fetal alcohol syndrome the darkest. You?"
1174,867,9/9/2021 18:24," the fans should try to write their own stories, not rehash someone else's. "," I felt sorry about him as well, his mother is in jail so what kind of life can he even have, did you hear about the overweight joung man, "
465,868,9/25/2021 0:38, Exactly. I think it's so funny authors used have to write on old typewriters. Now they have computers which can basically carry out any sequence of arithmetic or logical operations.," Yeah, that one was crazy, he had a lot against him. Kinda sad. It all stayed w me for awhile. Had to take a break from the book."
381,869,10/6/2021 19:08," Yes, the typewriter changes the relationship between the writer and the prose. i figure that the computer makes my writing different."," I agree, so do you like fiction? "
539,870,9/17/2021 22:45, Yes probably mine as well now that you mention it. If you have an Apple computer make sure you don't smoke near it because it voids the warranty. Very nice talking with you this afternoon.," I enjoy both fiction and non, however, I espcially like fiction books that have fact along with some imagination sprinkled in."
1056,871,9/30/2021 12:57," What about vaping? is vaping ok? LOL Yes, i enjoyed chatting!", I see well did you ever play the Super Smash Bros video game? there is actaully a long fiction piece about the game
1426,872,9/22/2021 4:13, Ha ha that is very important information I need to know too! Have a good afternoon.," Yeah, I've played that before, I'm more of a reader though lol. I actually read two of Tommy Orange's books, he had a lot of characters!"
1061,873,9/2/2021 15:20," Hello there, do you use Amazon?"," I guess thats a great book, I heard good things about it havent really read it, "
372,874,10/12/2021 6:20," Yes, I like Amazon, I like their movie site and their purchase website."," What are you more in to - literature, clothing or gaming?"
428,875,9/5/2021 17:19," Yeah I use their delivery service quite a bit, especially around Christmas. "," I like all three of them lol, clothing is also one of my favorite subjects and I also like technology"
193,876,9/22/2021 3:53," Amazon is a super large company, did you know chief executive own the Washington Post?"," I hear ya, I'm really into clothing too. Switching it up w textiles and materials. Did you know Apple had a clothing line in 1986?"
607,877,8/26/2021 5:42, No I didn't know that.  Do you know how much the first ever Amazon purchase was for?," I didnt, I would buy an Apple tshirt for sure, I wonder why they dont have that clothing line anymore"
660,878,9/22/2021 21:20," No I don't know, do you have any idea, if yes how much was the first purchase?"," Yeah same. Also, this was interesting, from 1912 to 1952 architecture, literature, music, painting and sculpture were olympic events. How cool"
1369,879,10/3/2021 19:58, Yeah it was for $27.95 and it was for the rights to name a building after themselves. ," Really cool indeed, they should be events even now, I wonder why they took them out!"
59,880,10/4/2021 5:43," Wow, I will always respect Amazon, because they offer thousandth of people employment rather or not they except it.", Are you a fan of fictions? 
34,881,8/26/2021 6:56," Yeah they do, do you know that the US postal service has a contract with Amazon to deliver on Sundays?", I am a fan somewhat!  I know that Edgar Allen Poe wrote the oldest known example of a cyborg in fictino.
398,882,10/9/2021 18:40," No I didn't know that, but I notice they Improve their delivery services to only a few days before receiving their packages.", I'm not a huge fan to be honest. 
1185,883,9/14/2021 12:45," Yeah they do.  On a different note, do you know much about sharks?", Hhaha I was when I was little more than I am now.  In the 1950's a judge tried to ban a science fiction comic because it featured a black character.  What a sad sign of the times back then.
31,884,9/14/2021 1:24," No, I don't, but I know there are different kind of sharks and they behave in different ways. I like seen them on TV, but not in real life.", Did you know the FDA burned 6 tons of literature in an act of censorship.
606,885,9/21/2021 1:58," Yeah I only know a little bit, I do know that because they have no bones on land, a sharks weight would crush its own body. ", I didn't know that.  There's a wiki that ranks fictional characters according to their powers and abilities.
202,886,9/26/2021 4:06," most people think that all sharks are killer sharks, but I read that all shark aren't killer sharks. Have you seen the movies about sharks?", Interesting. Who is the best? 
515,887,9/4/2021 6:33," No, just tv shows about them.  I think the Greenland shark and 5 gilled sharks are the most interesting.  The Greenland sharks live for a crazy amount of time!", I don't know.  We'll have to go look on wikipedia.  lol  I know someone who was the best one year though in literature and that was in 1953 when Winston Churchill won a nobel prize for literature.
952,888,10/12/2021 17:31," Yes you are right, I didn't know sharks didn't have ribs. I wonder how they upstand attacks from other animals from the waters?", That's pretty cool. It wasn't for peace? 
1388,889,10/1/2021 11:15, Yeah isn't that interesting.  I guess they also evolved earlier than dinosaurs as well. , Nope.  Literature was an olympic event from 1912 to 1952.  I wonder how they judged that?
346,890,9/24/2021 16:36," every show played on TV, always wonder how dolphins kill sharks? I notice dolphins always attack from the side."," LOL, by who could read the fastest? I have no idea. "
38,891,9/28/2021 17:32, Yeah I think you are right on that.  Dolphins are so interesting to me on how they communicate with each other. , Hmmm.....that I don't know.  I think it was some girl named ...Anne?
554,892,9/21/2021 9:46, Did you know sharks can be trained to bark like a dog?, Did you know that Apple had a clothing line in 1986? 
252,893,9/8/2021 11:44," Really? That is crazy, I wonder who thought of even trying that.  Well it was good talking with you, I hope you have a good night. ", I didn't know that.  I wonder if any of the pieces are worth money now as collectibles?
1342,894,8/26/2021 18:40," Hello friend, Do you like horses?", I'm not sure. It sounds like a horrible idea though. They should stick to phones. 
118,895,8/25/2021 17:56, I do. Did you know horses are able to sleep standing up and lying down?, lol  Yes.  Did you know that pilgrim clothing was full of color and they only wore black and white for special occasions?
1272,896,9/7/2021 10:21," Yes, that is cool. Did you know that the horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature, Eohippus, into the large single-toed animal of today? ", I can believe it. A lot of those photos I thought were for Sundays.
311,897,10/4/2021 7:15, That makes it even more impressive that there are over 300 breeds of horses in the world today., I always seem to remember school portraying them to wear black and white.  Rip Curl makes clothes in North Korea yet the label says Made in China.  I'm not familiar with that brand.  They sound shady to me.
610,898,9/1/2021 14:02," Yes, humans began domesticating horses around 4000 BC, and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BC. Some species were domesticated but then some are still living in the wild as feral horses."," Yeah, that doesn't seem legit. Well, nice chatting with you. "
1201,899,9/3/2021 5:33, I just heard that Icelandic horses have a fifth gear. Horses are simply fascinating., It was fun and nice chatting with you as well!
906,900,9/8/2021 2:07," Yes, I agree. There is an extensive specialized vocabulary used to described equine-related concepts, covering everything from anatomy to life stages, size, colors, markings, breeds, locomotion, and behavior.", Take it easy!
779,901,8/25/2021 10:34, What do you think about sharks? Did you know they're sister species to rays?, Dogs or cats!?
358,902,8/28/2021 7:57," Yes, fascinating fact!. And sharks can be trained like dogs to bark.", Dogs!  100%
73,903,8/26/2021 23:48," I kinda feel bad for them. They have no rib cages so if they ever end up on land, they get crushed by the weight of their body.", I KNEW I LIKED YOU! Google likes dogs too!
812,904,9/22/2021 8:06," Yes, sad indeed. Sharks even evolved earlier than dinosaurs and trees."," Hahaha.  yes,  definitely,  I know a few people who work there and they get to bring their dogs to work!!!!  I wish I could do that. "
321,905,9/26/2021 11:33, Have you ever seen the white shark cafe? It's where white sharks meet in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.," what, me too. I wouldn't get anything done but it would be amazing lol! Did you know dogs have 12 different blood types?"
745,906,8/31/2021 2:12," No, I've never seen it but I have heard about it.  Did you know that not just dolphins rescue sailors, but sharks too?", I did.  I guess I should get my dog checked for her blood type next time I see the vet.  Do you have a dog?
729,907,9/10/2021 11:56, I did know that. Animals cease to amaze me. We have to protect them at all costs.," I will have to, yes, his name is rocky, he is my favorite pet of all time, what is your dogs name?"
1492,908,9/10/2021 1:52, I agree. Do you do any online shopping on Amazon.com? Amazon sells almost everything from A to Z.," her name is Yuki, it means snow in Japanese,  she is a white dog lol She is a rescue so we dont know the breed,  shes a mutt. "
734,909,9/15/2021 6:21, I do. Did you know Amazon started as an online bookstore?," aww that is cute, rescue dogs tend to be the best! I want to clone my dog when he passes he is that good. They have cloned cats before, but no thanks to a cat"
826,910,9/24/2021 9:21," Yes, and then they later diversified to sell video downloads, MP3 downloads, audiobooks downloads, software, video games, electronics, apparel, furniture, food, toys, and jewelry. Wow."," lol that would be cool if you can clone your dog after they pass!  Ive had a few dogs and its heartbreaking.  I even took like 5 years break in between getting another one because I didnt know if I was ready.  Im not a cat person at all,  they are cute. "
1231,911,9/28/2021 22:39, Have you read anything about Amazon's proposed second HQ?," ha i agree with that. In japan there are more pets that kids under 15, that is a lot of pets!"
1486,912,9/17/2021 6:19," No, I did know that Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos built a clock into a mountain that should run for 10,000 years, though.", Oh wow.  I hope they aren't neglected in any way! 
530,913,10/13/2021 14:10, I did know. I don't really understand a lot of what Jeff Bezos does. That money could've been used better elsewhere., I hope not! Otherwise I am going there to stop it! They should do what boulder does and make it so you don't own pets but are their guardian
1418,914,9/4/2021 2:45," That could be. Maybe, he makes up for it by keeping his employees healthy.  Amazon warehouse workers walk between 7 and 15 minutes a day as part of their shift.  Nice chatting with you.", Yessssss!  I think they whole world should do that!  Did you know dogs can learn over a thousand words!  
1244,915,9/16/2021 19:16, Hey! I've been reading a lot lately. Do you read any fiction or poetry?," I did not know that! I know that only dogs and elephants respond to pointing, out of thousands of animals"
980,916,9/9/2021 15:18," Hi! Hm. I don't read much fiction or poetry, but I've been exposed to a lot of it in my lifetime. Do you have any favorites? I've tried my hand at creating both, and failed miserably! It's tough! It's an art form, that I just can't do!"," Also,  if you actually can stop countries from eating dog,  South Korea actually sells dog meat in their street markets!  I saw it when I visited there =( it was horrifying.  Yes,  I did know that elephants and dogs are so smart. "
1089,917,8/30/2021 7:27," I've been more into poetry lately. It's fascinating that it's been around since prehistorical times, with hunting poetry in Africa. "," that is so sad and so wrong. I think I remember there was a US person at the olympics that took dogs to save from being killed, it made me feel happy"
336,918,9/8/2021 23:35," Oh it's fascinating, for sure! Even more so to me since it eludes my abilities. heh. I've read that there is a poem which when read forwards is depressing, and when read backwards is inspiring! I'd really like to read it, but I can't find anything more about it, as of yet."," Thats amazing!  Did you know dogs have "" eureka"" moments where they feel happy solving a problem to get a reward?"
131,919,9/9/2021 9:14," That is fascinating. Similarly, Demetri Martin once wrote a 224 word palindrome poem. "," What can't dogs do! I know they aren't color blind like we were taught when young. It was so nice chatting with you, tell yuki hi!"
480,920,8/25/2021 14:21," Oh wow! Now there is a poem, I forgot that I loved! The Raven, by Edgar Allen Poe. It's been so long since I've heard it! I mean like 20+ years! Something about The Raven rap-tap-tapping on his door, or floor? Haha. I heard he only got $9 for the publication of that poem! Go figure.", Lol Same to Rocky!  Have a good one. 
763,921,10/12/2021 4:54," Wow! Just $9?! Somebody got a bargain! Did you know Edgar Allen Poe also wrote the oldest known example of a cyborg in fiction? Pretty diverse author, isn't he?", will do! bye!
1062,922,10/12/2021 5:01," Oh yeah? What an interesting person he must have been, in general! I don't even know what Javanese is , but apparently their alphabet when recited in order, is a poem. The ABC's are pretty poetic to me, now that we recite them so sing-songy.", That sure is an interesting way to send off a family member. I guess they didn't want to falsely memorialize her.
958,923,9/19/2021 7:40," I wonder what kind of poems a computer could come up with? Computers do everything else, they can control microwave ovens, remote controls, robots...why not write poetry, right?"," I know, I couldnt ever imagine writing something like that about my family.  I guess I am lucky.  "
857,924,10/11/2021 19:04," Haha! I'm slightly certain that soon, they will write poetry. Computers have come such a long way! I found something really interesting, in 1936 the Russians made a computer that ran off of water! I wonder what went wrong with that. Maybe electricity and water wasn't the best idea?", I feel the same way. I would rather just keep it brief and impersonal if I had hard feelings rather than publicly attack them.
1317,925,10/2/2021 8:00," Computers can be fairly delicate, I suppose. Smoking near apply computers voids the warranty by making it ""a biohazard"". What in the world could that mean?", It is said that you shouldn't speak ill of the dead.  I wouldn't feel like I needed to have the last word.
711,926,9/3/2021 1:42," Hm.. Yeah I know that smoking near them, just really clogs everything up, kind of taking dust and mixing it with the tarry nicotine and it creates a huge mess and can break a computer and completely stop the fans and such, but bio-hazard? I'm interested to learn why that is. Kinda scary!"," On a more enjoyable and lighter topic, do you have any pets? I have a dog."
1332,927,9/17/2021 10:41, Someone built a working 16 bit computer using nothing but the basic Minecraft building blocks. I wonder what kind warranty that one has?!, I don't.  I am not home very much.  But I do love animals.  I would think of myself as a cat person.
710,928,10/1/2021 14:37," Haha! Woah! There's a thing called transhumanists I guess, and they want to upload their brains to computers and memory sticks! I don't want to do that! One lifetime is okay by me. I can only imagine the torment of a mind having to just live for possibly forever! Yikes!"," Unfortunately I am allergic to cats so while I enjoy them in small doses, I don't think I could ever own one."
915,929,10/4/2021 16:02," I agree! What if people tried to read my mind's unpublished poetry! No thank you! I have some interesting fan fiction in my head, just like Julius Caesar wrote fan fiction of Hercules and Oedipus. But that's private!"," I always think it would be cool to own an exotic pet, although Id never want a bear like Roosevelt had.  "
632,930,9/27/2021 23:38, Haha! I am quite happy keeping my thoughts to myself! It sounds like a scary sci-fi movie to me! My computer brain gets arrested and imprisoned for eternity in 100 years for some crazy new law! No thank you!, I think he might be one of the few people who could pull off owning a bear. I would love to have one of the big cats as a pet but those are extremely dangerous as well.
421,931,8/28/2021 8:58," How much memory would it take to store all of us, anyway? Maybe less than I think. A space shuttle can run on 1mb of RAM. ", There are actually more tigers living as pets in Asia than in the wild.  I never though people would seriously own them in masses.
700,932,9/30/2021 20:49, That's crazy! Precisely why I'm not an astronaut! I wouldn't want to do crazy things such as trust my life to 1mb of ram! , I wonder if some of those are rescues and they are technically classified as pets. It would seem like there should be strict regulations to own one.
622,933,8/28/2021 19:01," Haha! There's a good science fiction  book, The Martian, which has some interestin parts about computers and space shuttles. That author had a pretty good imagination. "," I agree.  I would be too scared to own something that could seriously eat me in my sleep, or any other time it pleased."
1266,934,9/5/2021 13:57," Woah! In the 50's a judge tried to ban a sci-fi comic because it featured a black character! Thank goodness, we've come a long way from that hatefulness. But still we have a ways to go, before things are truly equal, really for all races."," It's scary enough to think that my own dog probably is strong enough to harm me, let alone one of the top predators in the world."
716,935,8/27/2021 6:47," Thank goodness, indeed. I agree with you, though, there is still progress to be made, and I think reading diverse fiction and poetry can help people see things from other perspectives. "," Dogs do understand pointing, along with elephants.  They are the only two animals who have that instinct.  Id love a baby elephant, but they can get kinda big."
743,936,9/14/2021 22:14, Oh absolutely! Really all art forms and most certainly the internet is going to bring humanity together on a much more even playing field. It was really nice talking with you!, I've seen videos online where baby elephants interact with humans in a similar style to puppies. It's a definite bucket list experience for me!
338,937,9/29/2021 0:24, Hello! Are you an Amazon Prime member?," Same here.  My girlfriend loves baby elephants, Ive tried to find a place we can go to have that experience.  I think it would be so cool, and a great surprise."
889,938,10/7/2021 16:30," Yes, I am and love it!  That two day delivery really comes in handy!!", In looking some of those places up you want to find a place that is a rescue type facility. Unfortunately there are places that exploit the elephants and do not treat them well.
1186,939,9/16/2021 23:29, It really does! Even Sunday delivery rocks especially since Amazon contracted with the USPS.," Definitely, not looking for somewhere they abuse the animals.  We're both big animal lovers.  I kind of like the philosophy in Boulder, CO where you can't own pets, but you are their guardian."
1104,940,9/16/2021 23:12," Yes, I think that was good for the USPS!  How would you like to have a building named after yourself for being a customer and only spend $27.95?", For me my pets have always been family. I care for them more than I do some people I know.
817,941,9/23/2021 0:22, If only I knew about it years ago!!!!! I didn't realize they own IMDB as well!, Definitely a lot more loyal and loving than people
1012,942,8/28/2021 12:54," I know, I didn't either!  Thinking the amazon warehouse workers don't need a gym membership with walking 7-15 miles each day on a shift! Omg!"," She's also a lot more straightforward. She wants food, to be pet, more food, and to play with her ball. No guess work needed there."
131,943,9/6/2021 19:58, I would be the fittest man alive working there haha. They ought to use horses there! Especially Icelandic horses that can speedwalk!, Very true.  Pets are pretty easy to please.  
1160,944,9/5/2021 17:27," Ha, ha, ha, Yes!! Good idea, I love horses, Guess you can't ride your horses to school on, no vehicle day or you can get suspended.", That's probably why they're so popular worldwide!
1397,945,9/30/2021 5:44, Oh I know I saw that two high school students did that! I remember kids would drive their tractors to my high school!, Do you own a dog?

64,947,8/26/2021 4:57, You would have never guessed since he rode like hundreds of them! He should have rode sharks instead!," No, I didn't. I bet that is why they call them man's best friend. "
589,948,9/4/2021 21:47," Well, I guess sharks have been around a long time. Makes sense they were here before the trees and dinosaurs!!"," I guess so. They perform so many roles for humans, like hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, and companionship. I guess there's a reason why they are called that. They do a lot for humans."
1236,949,8/24/2021 23:39, Crazy to think that is one long time! I didn't know they could be trained like dogs to bark!, Yeah. Apparently there are 12 different types of blood that a dog may have.

580,953,9/25/2021 18:56, Yes I think it was! It all makes sense to me now haha. They really are. I don't know many animals or things that can change colors of their skin!," No, I've never been to turkey. Have you been? "

I was stationed there for a few months so I didn't get to see too much. I didn't know that.

102,958,10/12/2021 14:28," Hey there, heard anything interesting lately? I sure have, did you know Amazon contributed 38 billion to the city of Seattle's economy just by being there? "," I didn't know that, would you call that a ""copy cat?"" haha"
1299,959,10/9/2021 18:56," Hi, no I did not know. It looks like amazon means exciting news. They are now looking for a site for a second headquarters!"," Hilarious, well there are more tigers living as pets in the US than living in the wild in Asia. "
727,960,8/28/2021 3:25," That's great! Not everyone thinks so though, Amazon can come with difficulties in transportation and shoot up the housing costs of whatever city it's in. "," That's crazy, I heard that Theodore Roosevelt had over 20 pets, including a bear and a hyena. "
1229,961,10/8/2021 5:37, They do make an impact wherever they go. I found interesting that there is a building named after the first amazon.com customer," Yeah, he was a big conservationist. What number president was he?"
1455,962,9/4/2021 16:02," I heard they're considering Washington as a place for their 2nd HQ, wherever they put the building is going to get a huge boost! I heard they're even considering New York!", I believe he was the 26th. Did you know that in Japan there's more pets than there are children under 15?

353,972,10/8/2021 19:48," That's incredible, they also have a publishing arm known as Amazon publishing for people who want to publish their eBooks through them!"," I wonder what the difference is?  Teddy Roosevelt had over 20 pets.  I didn't know this, but he had a bear (teddy bear)."
535,973,9/29/2021 22:20," that is good! Hey, do you like animals?"," Wow, that's an interesting fact.  Check this out. In japan, there are more pets than there are children under 15"

824,975,9/6/2021 21:20," Di you know that they meet in the pacific ocean, in a place named ""white Shark cafe"". I love coffee but I would try not to end up there!", I've heard that.  Are pets also used in their meals?

1414,981,8/24/2021 13:28, good morning," That's nuts.  Many scientists have advanced degrees in an area of science and pursue careers in various sectors of the economy such as academia, industry, government, and nonprofit environments."
1036,982,8/30/2021 19:14, Do you keep up with the election?, Scientist wasn't a term until the 19th century
120,983,9/9/2021 6:17," yeah, but moderately.  You?"," Really?  On another note, Google prefers dogs to cats. their code of conduct specifically states that they are a dog company."
977,984,9/19/2021 3:56," yes, about the same. I know there are the republican and democrat party.", Does that mean they donate more to dogs?
1217,985,9/24/2021 1:10, the only election that I follow is the Presidential Election," I'm not sure on that.  Dogs vary widely in shape, size and colors. "
431,986,9/7/2021 17:15, Same here. I don't follow local as I do not live in the same state more than 3 years at a time.," I don't know how, but there are more tigers living as pets in the US than living wild in Asia.  I didn't even know you could have one as a pet.  Sounds Dangerous!"
1249,987,9/2/2021 0:22, I see. Do you know who has a higher authority than a state's governor?, Fiction works comes from the imagination.
906,988,9/8/2021 11:23, I think state senator. DId you know there hasn't been a president that wasn't a republican or democrat since 1853, Yes. I like fiction. There is a wiki that ranks fictional characters according to their powers.
1060,989,9/22/2021 10:11, Very interesting.  Was this President an independence in your opinion?," Fun, Julius caesar actually wrote fan fiction of hercules."
448,990,9/29/2021 21:21, I think so. I dont know if any green party have ever been elected. Did you know all presidents with beards have been republican.?, That is intriguing. Edgar Allen Poe wrote the oldest known example of a cyborg in fiction. Did you hear that?
516,991,9/26/2021 7:41, Just know about this fact by now.  Which party do you think will win the next Presidential Electin?," Great, George rr martin doesn't like fan fiction at all."
982,992,9/30/2021 19:20, I think the republicans will win. Do you think someone will run against Trump on the republican ballot next time?, I heard that. He thinks it's copyright infingement.
1009,993,9/21/2021 8:45," I believe the current Texas's governor, but I do not remember his name"," Yes he does, Snakes are legless and carnivores."
876,994,9/22/2021 23:03, Ancient Athens did their appointment by lottery instead of election.," Ah. Yeah, There is a genus of flying snakes that can launch themselves at prey."
967,995,10/12/2021 0:20," It is weird, but true"," Scary, New zealand doesn't have any snakes."
199,996,8/24/2021 5:31," The Beatles song ""come together"" was written for a California governor.", That sounds great. There are legless lizards... almost as frightening as snakes.
164,997,9/29/2021 13:07, There somehow was a connection between Beatles band and California politics.," Yes, some of them have eyelids and ears!"
1469,998,10/5/2021 3:50, Did you know North Dakotas governor declared martial law in 1934 and seceded from the U.S, That's creepy. Makes me want to listen to music. Do you like rap?
298,999,10/13/2021 17:40," I did not know about this fact.  I am wondering if it is still in effect.  By the way, nice chatting with you"," Yes, Tupac's music is in the library of congress."

586,1001,9/15/2021 6:54, hi are you a republican?," Interesting, rap is normally delivered over a beat."
1463,1002,8/30/2021 22:12, No I am not. How about you?," Yes. It's original meaning was ""to lightly strike"".  Now it describes quick speech."
651,1003,10/4/2021 14:44," No I am not, I am a Libertarian. Maybe one of us will win soon, it hasn't happened since 1853."," Yes, eminem wanted to be a comic book artist."
90,1004,10/2/2021 6:12," Well I am just hoping Trump doesn't win a second term next year, but with how corrupt everything is now it is looking like a very likely outcome.", Intriguing. Did you hear about the judge in Michigan who delivered a ruling againt him? She delivered it by rapping when she ruled.
967,1005,10/10/2021 12:30," I do too, I don't particularly like him. Did you vote last election"," Funny, the earliest rap was in the west african tradiation."
1043,1006,10/7/2021 13:24," I did, I voted Hillary even though I didn't really care for her either, but she was a much better choice than what we ended up with.", Oh. Seems reasonable I guess. Did you know that flow is a component of rap?
221,1007,9/14/2021 23:08," For sure, I voted third party. I was part of the problem, I wanted a 3rd party to win because it has been years!"," Yes, flow and delivery."
1154,1008,8/29/2021 10:26," Well Bernie Sanders just announced his 2020 run, so if he actually makes it onto the ballot this year I will vote for him.", Good morning.  Do you like snakes?
417,1009,10/6/2021 1:15," Yea, he got taken out of the running in 2016 by hillary. I am voting BIDEN!", Not really!  lol  I guess I do as long as they leave me alone.
1271,1010,9/17/2021 6:56," If Biden decided to run in 2020 i would probably choose him over Bernie, I always liked him when he was VP.", Same here.  Personally I'd like to live in New Zealand. I hear they don't have any snakes there.
346,1011,10/6/2021 8:08," For sure, and he would take Trump down.", Nice!  I didn't know that.  Only 70 percent of the worlds snakes lay eggs.
88,1012,10/3/2021 15:55," I am not sure anyone can take Trump down at this point, with all the rumored election rigging and ties to Russia, I personally think he will just cheat to win again and no one will do anything about it, just like these last 4 years.", Seriously?  Then I guess the rest do live births?
1465,1013,10/10/2021 20:04," Right, I figured the same thing! I don't think he's good and if he wins I think we know for sure it was rigged.", Yes.  Boas and some others give live birth.
212,1014,10/13/2021 20:05," Well one problem is the election is based on the electoral college more than actual peoples votes. If we could get rid of the electoral college and get back to the popular vote, like it should be, he wouldn't even have won the first time.", Well that's creepy.  It's as creepy as knowing there are some snakes that can fly.
90,1015,9/27/2021 0:43, For sure. They should do it like athens did back in the day. Use a lottery system to prevent oligarchy! I think he is cheating the system," Yikes!  I don't want to see those.  Not even in a zoo.  lol  When snakes are born with 2 heads, they fight each other food.  That's creepy too.  Is that a common thing with snakes?????"
1418,1016,10/10/2021 22:59," Yep and nothing is being done about it. Bill Clinton cheated on his wife and every one through a fit and started impeachment proceedings, but Trump supposedly gets away with treason and it really grinds my gears.", i don't know. That does seem really weird to picture a snake fighting itself.
486,1017,9/2/2021 12:51," For sure, and cheating on his wife a bunch of times!", I know right?  I'm going to have to google it.  A man has been bitten so many times by snakes that his blood is able to be used as antivenom.  I wouldn't want to be him.
1348,1018,9/24/2021 15:10," yeah Clinton was not a good husband but he was a pretty darn good president, I will never understand why his personal life mattered to so many people, and then when it looks like we have an actual traitor in the seat no one seems to care.", Me either.  They say that our brains are naturally hard wired to be afraid of snakes.
1469,1019,8/23/2021 0:02," for sure, people made good money and the economy was great! Good chatting with you!", I believe it.  I jump and shout when I see one. lol  Australia is the only continent where ven9omous snakes outnumber the non-venomous ones.
748,1020,9/16/2021 23:44," Yeah same to you, good chat.", I totally believe that. i've seen things about that country on tv.  They seem to have a lot of scary creatures over there.
233,1021,8/25/2021 3:21, bye!," Those salt water crocs. I wouldn't want to cross paths with either from there. lol  Some owls keep blind snakes in their nests as helpful associates, reducing the abundance of nest parasites.  How interesting is that?  ...and how do they know they are blind? lol"
312,1022,8/25/2021 4:07," Hello, do you follow politics much?"," Wow, that is actually a good question! I don't know. I do know that oddly enough, crocodiles are more closely related to birds than snakes and lizards."
1332,1023,8/24/2021 20:33," Hi I do from time to time, it is hard to escape them all together. Did you know every republican president has had a beard? ", That's interesting!  Do you happen to read any fiction at all?
608,1024,10/13/2021 3:57, Oh pretty cool fact. And since 1853 the president has been either a republican or a democrat," I used to.  I like the older fiction.  Speaking of, cyborgs are a lot older than we think.  Edgar Allen Poe wrote the oldest known example of one in one of his works."
928,1025,10/11/2021 21:21," Wow pretty dominant. THey did not start using the colors red and blue until 2000, I thought it was earlier than that", I didn't know that.  The term robotics was accidentally coined by science fiction author Isaac Asimov in 1941.
1229,1026,9/27/2021 2:34," Yeah it does feel late, you are right. Did you hear about Truman and his refusal to take a photo on the dumbo ride?", I didn't know that!  So he just accidentally made it up?
282,1027,9/14/2021 15:54," Yeah he just id not want to be associated with Republicans in any way, shape or form and the dumbo is their logo", I guess so.  lol  Do you know what a drabble is?
115,1028,9/1/2021 5:04, Yup pretty much. DO you know how officials were elected in ancient athens?, i honestly have no idea.
1147,1029,8/27/2021 2:07," Yes by lottery, and I wonder how that would work nowadays probably a mess"," Hi, how are you?"
119,1030,8/24/2021 0:27," Hahah agreed. In Nevada you have the options to not vote for any of the candidates, I like that"," Hi, I'm Good. Have you heard of the book Strange objects? It is going to be a HBO miniseries. Many critics think it it the author's break through."
132,1031,9/29/2021 17:21," Me too, I wish it were in all the states. Too bad not a lot of people show up at the polls though", I have not heard of the book or the miniseries. I do have HBO and will look for it when it comes out.
437,1032,9/29/2021 0:45, Yeah I hope we can go past that almost 63%. We need to all vote, That is good. It focuses on how the female characters negatively treat one another. It is unusual because it gives it's female characters permission to be bad.
676,1033,9/14/2021 19:23, Yes I agree. Since 1990 it seems the taller candidate has been winning the election. Coincidence?," Nice. I think I do remember that one now. It's with Amy Adams I think... I did see Gone Girl, did you see that one?"
1270,1034,9/9/2021 5:35, Hmm interesting one. DO you know what the Beatles song Come together was written for?," I didn't, but I know it is by the same author, Gillian Flynn. The author wrote Sharp Objects because she wanted to explore how women aren't innately good and was sick of literature's tendency to portray women as spunky girls or bad girls like tramps and vamps."
408,1035,9/17/2021 12:36, Yeah it was for the California governor Timothy Leary in 1969," lynn's novels are feminist precisely because they aim a megawatt beam, bright as prison lights, into the dark corners of women's minds and lives"
811,1036,8/25/2021 0:24, Yeah that one. When Schwarzenegger was governor of California he did not live in Sacramento and commuted ever day," I think you can really see this in the first line of Sharp Objects, where she write that ""I was never a good little girl."" Amy Dunne in Gone Girl was the same way."
1434,1037,8/25/2021 19:52," But he did not have it rough, he travelled by private jet 3 hours each day", There's a wiki which ranks fictional characters according to their powers and abilities.
1491,1038,8/25/2021 6:49, Good for him I guess. North Dakota governor declared martial law in 1934," That is interesting. I wonder if Camille's (from Sharp Objects) beauty could be considered a power or ability. The novel manages to put an interesting spotlight on it. But, it doesn't reduce her or her beauty to an archetype."
316,1039,9/26/2021 15:20, Yes and then seceded from the US. WOw, Couldn't it be both? Couldn't her looks be a power and a liability when she uses them inappropriately?
338,1040,8/27/2021 23:14," In Texas, the first female governor was elected before other stated had ratified the amendment"," Yes, that is a good point. I bet the author would like that give her attempts to avoid the archetypes surrounding beauty in fiction. Camille is neither an angel or a temptress."
678,1041,9/2/2021 15:39," Nice, seems they were a bit more ahead of time/. Ralph Lawrence  Carr was the only governor that did not agree with the internment of japane americans during WWII", Her beauty is part of her underlying charatcher which allows her to have so many more dimensions than just beauty.
905,1042,10/7/2021 17:33, Must have been tough being the only guy.," True, of course some people think that the author goes to far by making all her female characters unlikable. They think that this undermines women by portraying them this way."
182,1043,9/5/2021 0:31, The Republican Party is really popular in the states do you agree?, I always question how the author should portray the protaginist in her own books... What's appropriate for the author is not for the reader. 
45,1044,10/4/2021 7:11, Unfortunately yes.  It is not like the republican party of old times., So true that the author and reader can differ on interpretations. I am glad that the author doesn't fetishize violence though. Many authors do that. She likes to show how it can be deadly to be male too.
342,1045,10/10/2021 7:29," Yeah a lot of things have changed, funny anecdote with Truman and Dumbo though", That's a really good point and a nuance most miss. I believe great authors can use sexism and sex as a great distinguisher yet subtle at the same time. 
67,1046,9/2/2021 5:43, That is a good one.  Poor Dumbo.  He probably didnt realize what was happening.  They should have brought out Eeyore instead.," True, it is interesting how Flynn tries to be psychologically accurate above all. "
1045,1047,8/28/2021 20:14," I know right Dumbo didnt have the fault lol, I bet he isnt a Republican either,"," Going inside the mind of a ficticious person, created in your mind, must be difficult."
608,1048,10/2/2021 17:44, Probably not.  He might wear blue for all we know., It's true. Have you ever read drabbles? they are only 100 words long. It is interesting to think how you could go into someone's mind in 100 words. It must be different then a long novel like sharp objects.
565,1049,9/14/2021 19:56," So the red and blue colors, seem like they have been around forever but its a recent thing from the year 2000", Nice chatting with you.
534,1050,9/13/2021 3:27, That is surprising!  I feel like they have always been there as far back as I can remember.," Hi, how are you?"
457,1051,10/1/2021 9:11," It sure seems like a lot longer, so elections are really important Im just glad we have that choice many countries dont"," Great! Hope you're doing well! Are you a fan of fiction by chance? If so, there's a wiki you should check out that ranks characters in fiction by their powers and abilities!"
533,1052,8/26/2021 22:15," Very true, which is why it is surprising election turnout hasnt gotten above 63%", I do like comics. I fell in love with it when Edgar allen poe wrote about it.
1034,1053,9/18/2021 5:02," And thats how we end up with leaders like Trump lol, also the taller candidate wins 75% of the time, interesting stat"," He wrote the oldest known example of a cyborg, correct? That is awesome! Fiction is derived from the imagination and Poe had a great imagination!"
58,1054,10/12/2021 15:53, So we need to find someone taller than him for 2020.  Lets start searching now. lol, Yeah. I liked Poe. Tell Tale Heart scared the heck out of me!
97,1055,9/2/2021 18:38," We sure do lol, did you know Nevada is the only state with the option ''None of these''", So true! I would like to read some of Julius Caesar's Hercules fan fiction sometimes. Or even Oedipus. I bet it's amazing.
1243,1056,9/30/2021 3:58, They have that?  Ok... im kinda jealous now., Just don't show George martin any... He's not a fan of fan fiction...
118,1057,9/28/2021 13:57," They do, seems like the best option at times lol"," Ha! Yeah I heard he claimed it's copyright infringement and also bad exercises for aspiring writers. I mean, he's not wrong, but a little over the top I'd say!"
270,1058,10/4/2021 13:23, It really does.  , I think fan fiction is good. I bet he also complains that people do not write enough or how it is  lonely experience and then also complains about flattery... Seems like an inconsistent thought process.
1217,1059,9/20/2021 1:46, I think one of the best governors is Schwarzenegger would be cool to have the terminator as president one day, Agreed! It's almost as ignorant as the judge who tried to ban a science fiction  comic all because it featured a black character back in 1950! The audacity of some people!
29,1060,10/10/2021 2:55, It really would1, And in 2001 a judge delivered her ruling in the form of a rap. Stay in your lane your honor!
1331,1061,8/23/2021 10:39," He is a great actor but also a great politician, he has done a lot for California and is a really popular guy"," Ha! While trying a suit filed against Eminem! I heard about that. Speaking of Eminem, crazy he wanted to be a comic book artist growing up. What might have been had he pursued that instead if rap!"
457,1062,9/8/2021 21:51," He really has.  Did you know he commuted by private jet each day, 3 hours!", yeah. I think he chose wisely. I am not sure how successful he would have been at compliment rap though.
625,1063,9/19/2021 18:32," Sounds like a really busy guy, anyways its time for lunch, its been great chatting with you but Im taking a break, thanks a lot", Ha! Can't believe That's even a thing. But I suppose it's popular enough in Korea so it must be at least intriguing to see!
1240,1064,9/12/2021 9:13, What did you think of the last couple elections?," Intriguing, like Busta Rhymes voicing the reptar wagon in Rugrats?"
29,1065,8/26/2021 17:15, I think it has been great for the country. people have come to realize the power of the vote., Did he really? I'll have to go back and watch that movie now just to see if I recognize his voice! Ha! Reptar was a lizard right? Better that than a snake - or even a flying snake which there happens to be a genus of that can actually launch themselves at their prey. Imagine coming across one of those. Yikes!
1068,1066,10/8/2021 13:53, That is a great point. I want to keep seeing more and more voter turnout. It hasn't been more than 62.8 percent in 100 years, Nope! I would run so fast! I am not a snake fan and then throw in a flying snake.... NOPE!
593,1067,9/2/2021 21:56, the vote should be mandatory. then people would see the power of the ballot., Same here. It's crazy that the fear of snakes is hard wired in both the brains of humans and monkeys! 
844,1068,10/13/2021 4:11," I agree, I am sure other countries do that. I don't think we should go back to how ancient athens did it, do you know how?"," I know. Poor monkeys have no idea, they just run. My 7 year old asked about getting a snake and I shut that down quickly!"
261,1069,8/26/2021 16:35, i think they used a lottery. that would help avoid power falling into certain hands consistenly.," I don't blame you. I wouldn't want a snake or even one of those legless lizards that look like snakes even though they basically aren't. If it looks like a snake, I don't want it!"
1252,1070,9/24/2021 1:00, yea and hoping the lottery would not allow an oligarchy. I wonder if that worked or not, Nice chatting with you!
554,1071,8/26/2021 18:52," it probably slowed it down. officials can still bribed, even randomly elected ones."," Hello, do you like movies?"
1367,1072,9/14/2021 20:31, Yea you're right. I am sure it was rigged. How do you like Republicans?, I do. Do you like movies?
979,1073,8/29/2021 19:03," well, they can be bribed after the fact once elected. The country has shifted farther right, so they are pretty far right now.", I do quite a bit. DO you know who hold the record for the most box hits?
175,1074,10/8/2021 12:41, Yea that is a good point. is your governer part of that far right?, Denzel Washington?
1288,1075,10/2/2021 13:43," no, i dont think so. i think that the far right is usually in the south. ", It id actually Tom Hanks with $8.5 billion worldwide
723,1076,9/21/2021 15:02," Yea I think so too, our governor is republican but not a far right one. There was only one governor who opposed internment of japanese people in ww2", WOW! I did love him as the voice of Woody in toy story but I just love pixar.
1390,1077,9/23/2021 11:32," yeah, during wartime it is hard to stop people from acting on hate. i expect that could happen again soon if there is war with chna.", I love Pixar too. Did you know Disney wanted to shut down their studio because sleeping beauty was a bust
109,1078,9/3/2021 20:29," for sure, I am sure something big will happen in our lifetime. It is bound to happen. I still can't believe schwarzenegger was governor", That would have been short sighted. Can you imagine making only $309? I would be so sad...
1493,1079,10/10/2021 13:05," he had notoriety to launch a campaign. if you are rich, famous, tall, etc you can run for govt. i figure the future is all about marketing, not content."," I know, but good thing they did not shut down the studio"
45,1080,9/24/2021 11:53, He was the terminator! That is all he needed! lol, Can you imagine taking your valentines to silence of the lambs?
378,1081,9/15/2021 4:26," yeah, the governator. he was not a good speaker but people knew him. he didnt get much done because he didnt understand politics."," No, that would be horrible. Do you know which was one of the most expensive office flops?"
753,1082,9/9/2021 16:03," For sure, I would have voted for him if I was in california, even though he ruined the state. "," No, which one?"
822,1083,8/27/2021 7:53," people that should run government do not run for office. if they run for office, we probably dont want them in there.", It was Treasure Planet
1305,1084,9/18/2021 14:35, I agree with you. It was so nice chatting with you!, I had no clue?
311,1085,9/26/2021 16:33, No. I think it's so interesting that the Republican Party is referred to as the Grand old party.," Yeah, too bad for them. Do you like comedy?"
583,1086,9/3/2021 10:51, I agree.  I wonder why they gave themselves that moniker.  ," yes, I do. Do you?"
54,1087,9/6/2021 0:01, Yeah I'm not sure. But every US president with a beard has been Republican., Yes me too. Do you know which movie Bill Murray thinks is the best comedy?
1115,1088,10/9/2021 15:41, True.  I also heard that Hillary Clinton was president of the young republicans when she was in college., stripes?
536,1089,9/21/2021 11:22, Oh that's interesting especially given the fact that she just ran Democrat. The red and blue colors for Republicans and Democrats only started in 2000., Actually Kung Fu Hustle
827,1090,10/3/2021 22:58, That really got me.  I thought they were always around representing the parties.  , WOW! I would have thought it would have been a good movie and not that one. I wonder if he was being sarcastic.
578,1091,9/28/2021 16:28, Yeah me too but it sounds like they used to use animals more. Truman seem to take that very seriously especially at Disneyland., I am wondering about it too. He called it the supreme achievement of the modern age in comedy. Nice chat :)
1004,1092,9/9/2021 22:36, I heard... poor Dumbo.  He probably didnt even understand., Hello do you like movies?
641,1093,9/20/2021 23:56, Ha ha yeah I bet he was so confused. It's funny to think that ride has been around since 1957.," Yes, I do.  How about you?"
507,1094,8/28/2021 3:12," It really is, it was my favorite as a kid, much to the detriment of my parents.  LOL", awesome!  Yes I love movies. Tom hanks is the highest box office star!
154,1095,10/12/2021 3:41, Haha thats funny. Apparently officials in ancient athens were appointed by lottery because they believe elections would lead to oligarchy.," I love him, he's such a versatile actor and has played in some of my favorite movies.  Did you know Disney thought about shutting down their studio after Sleeping beauty flopped at the box office?"
283,1096,9/23/2021 7:30, Well elections also lead to a dog being elected mayor... so I dont know what is worse.," Yikes, was it that bad?  I have only seen it like once or twice lol.  Glad they didnt, they have come out with some really good stuff"
308,1097,9/11/2021 5:08, Haha yes good point. I hope that one day the voter turnout for presidential elections will breach 63%.," I know right?  I loved it as a kid, I didn't think it was that bad.  You know I knew Silence of The Lambs made lots of money at the box office, but I didn't realize it came out on Valentine's day in 1991.  Did you?"
1448,1098,9/20/2021 21:07, Me too.  Did you know the faster blinker has lost every election since 1980.  Who even calculates that data.," Yeah, so romantic right!  lol that was a great movie,  kinda ironic about the valentines day thing lol"
866,1099,9/14/2021 1:13, Yeah that is definitely an odd stat., Did you watch the Avengers: Infinity Wars movie ?
109,1100,10/8/2021 12:24, There is even a cat that placed 3rd in the Virginia Senate election.  How can animals even run?  That is just crazy," Yes, I did,  great movie as well,  I hear it was filmed in all imax cameras! "
1380,1101,8/26/2021 11:39," Haha i guess you can vote for anything. Like blinking, another odd stat is the tallest candidate has won in 75% of elections."," I loved it too!  Can't wait for the next one, I'll probably cry all over again, when I see who all died at the end of the movie."
107,1102,9/20/2021 22:15, So we need to look for a slow blinker and a tall person for 2020., Yeah coming out next month I think.  It was pretty sad at the end.  Bring tissue this time!
932,1103,9/6/2021 9:51," Yeah they will no doubt win! Nevada is actually the only state to have a ""none of these"" candidates voting option."," Thanos sucks!  Anyway, I haven't seen RBG, have you?"
624,1104,10/4/2021 23:42," That is brilliant, especially if it forces new candidates.", What is that?
88,1105,10/5/2021 10:54, Yea more states should do it maybe. More states should elect women too. Texas elected their first female governor before some states even ratified the 19th amendment!," Movie about the life of Ruth Bader Ginsburg.  It sounded too dry and I'm not much of a feminist, so I passed on that one."
1102,1106,10/10/2021 6:40, Do you follow politics?," Oh that one,  no I didnt watch it lol I did read about it. Do you like comedy?"
794,1107,9/20/2021 4:12, I do. I just learned that the Republican Party was founded by anti-slavery activists. Surprising.," Yes, I do.  Mostly old stuff with Bill Murray, though!"
146,1108,10/10/2021 23:41, I never knew that.  There hasn't been a US president who wasn't a Republican or Democrat since 1853.," Hes amazing,  real funny!  He thinks kung fu hustle is the supreme acchievement of modern age in terms of comedy.  I dont know about that,  it was a great movie,  but not amazing lol what do you think?"
298,1109,8/25/2021 13:59, That's a good thing! Did you know in 1957 President Harry Truman visited Disneyland and refused to be photographed on the Dumbo ride so he wouldn't be associated with the Republican Party?," Me either, he must have had a few when he said that!  What I found astonishing was that 3rd rock from the sun beat out Seinfeld, Fraser,and Friends for the 1997 Golden Globe."
1040,1110,9/28/2021 12:27, That's funny!  Consistent use of the red and blue colors for Republicans and Democrats started in 2000.  Could have swore they used those colors before then.," Yeah 3rd rock was funny,  but I dont think its better than seinfeld or friends. lol "
183,1111,10/10/2021 12:28," Really? I thought so too! Did you know Nevada is the only state to have a ""none of these candidates"" voting option for Presidential elections?"," I agree, Seinfeld and Friends are classics.  I smell a bribe!"
1331,1112,8/27/2021 2:17, I didn't know that.  Every US president with a beard has been a Republican.  Interesting., Right!  lol Its weird that comedy central has cancelled over 100 shows.  
183,1113,9/13/2021 23:33, Huh. I never noticed! Hard to believe voter turnout for US Presidential elections hasn't breached 62.8% in the last 100 years.," Yeah, that is kind of odd!  Well, it's been nice chatting with you, I need to go walk my dog, now.  "
434,1114,10/10/2021 8:58, That's an amazing statistic.  Wow.  Since 1900 the taller candidate has won the US presidential election 75 percent of the time.," Great chatting, thanks. "
19,1115,9/22/2021 21:47, Oh that is funny! During the 2012 US elections international electoral observers were blocked from the polls in 9 states., Did know Tom Hanks is the highest all-time box office star?
1306,1116,9/19/2021 8:00, Interesting.  Do you ever vote for the governor in your state?  I do.," I didnt know that, I love him as an actor, he is so talented I guess that makes sense"
1282,1117,9/19/2021 4:47," I do. Can you believe when Arnold Schwarzenegger was governor of CA he never lived in Sacramento, instead he commuted 3 hours every day by private jet."," Disney should have used Tom in ""treasure planet"" it was the most expensive box office flop of all time. HAHA"
1488,1118,8/23/2021 16:04, Didn't know that.  I bet that would get old though flying like that every day.," I bet the movie would have had a bigger box office with him in the movie, did you watch Trojan Wars?"
754,1119,9/27/2021 20:32, It is certainly a lot. Did you know the Beatles song Come Together was actually written for Tim Leary's 1969 CA Governor campaign.," No, I didn't. I read that it earned over $309,000,000 in box office. Someone is rich."
1418,1120,9/13/2021 8:57, I had no idea.  Wonder why a British band at the time would write a song for an American election?  Interesting.," No, only $309 dollars, it was a failure in fact, it was one of the most expensive box office flops all time"
1486,1121,9/19/2021 7:49, Very! Did you know Ralph Lawrence Carr was the only Governor to oppose the internment of Japanese Americans during WW2?, Oh! Thanks for that. I read it wrong.
1288,1122,8/31/2021 5:18, I didn't know that.  I've heard about when they did that though to those people.," Yeah, the budget was of $15 million dollars, did you ever watch the movie The Silence of the Lambs?"
613,1123,9/15/2021 13:44," It's something else, that's for sure."," Yes, that is a very scary movie."
1300,1124,9/6/2021 1:45, In 1934 I see that North Dakota's governor declared martial law and seceded from the US.  I'm learning all kinds of new things today., It came out on Valentines day and it had a good box office. That was in the year 1991
642,1125,9/16/2021 20:17," Wow! Well, Texas elected their first female Governor, the second in the nation, before some states even ratified the 19th amendment. "," Yes, I think I read $270 million in box office."
1329,1126,9/20/2021 10:42, Looks like Texas was ahead of the times!  Thanks for chatting!," Yeah, that was a total success so do you like comedy films as well"
407,1127,10/8/2021 14:10, Are you aware that the taller candidate for president has won 75% of the elections of them time. , I love comedy. It's my favorite.
392,1128,9/8/2021 8:13, Hello - it doesn't surprise me. I've even heard that taller people in interviews for jobs tend to get the job more often., Do you like Bill Murray? he seems to like Kung Fu hustle a lot. 
297,1129,9/14/2021 4:33," Crazy, is that true? ", I do like him but I don't know kung fu hustle.
495,1130,9/3/2021 20:51," Not sure how true it is, but that's what I've been told. Did you know Hillary Clinton was president of young republicans in college?"," He says is the supreme achievement of modern comedy, well I dont agree with that, I didnt like that movie really"
1271,1131,8/26/2021 9:30, I'm not surprised. Did you know Arnold traveled 3 hours a day to Sacramento when he was the governor? , I totally agree with you.
860,1132,8/28/2021 22:38, Wow that's crazy. I can't imagine traveling that far for work. , Do you like the channel Comedy Central?
762,1133,8/31/2021 7:23, Me either. Did you know Tim Leary ran for governor of CA? , I have watched a few shows on there. My son loves it.
1468,1134,9/9/2021 12:08," I did not know that, but that's interesting. I didn't know congress has played a democrat vs. republican baseball game every year since 1909. ", I love it as well but it makes me mad that they've cancelled over 100 shows since its creation
421,1135,10/3/2021 19:24," I did, it must be one boring game! ", I would think that what is funny changes over time.
507,1136,9/22/2021 0:38, Yea I bet it is a very boring game. A cat named Hank placed third in a Virginia senate election once before. , Yeah I guess so but many of those shows were good! anyways its been nice chatting with you today
353,1137,8/27/2021 19:46, I can believe it. Did you know Nevada is the only stat that has a none of these candidates as a voting option? , Nice chatting with you too.
87,1138,10/12/2021 3:27, Wow I didn't know that about Nevada. , good morning.
127,1139,9/15/2021 19:19," Yeah, must be an interesting state to live in. Have you ever visited there? ", Hi there!  Do you like comedies?
1379,1140,10/4/2021 22:30, I have been to Las Vegas twice. What about you?, Yeah I love a good comedy.
145,1141,9/23/2021 3:17," Yeah, I've been. But I don't think a majority of the people that visit there vote. ", Me too!  Did you see Bill Murray's Kung Fu Hustle?
1424,1142,10/2/2021 11:06," Yea, I'm not too sure on that. I saw that all elections conducted in Oregon are conducted by mail.", I think I may have seen it. I dont see it as the supreme achievement in comedy like he does though.
495,1143,9/3/2021 6:24," Interesting. It rains a lot in Oregon, have you ever visited? ", I was going to ask what you thought about it.  Jack Black was going to star in the Green Lantern which was originally supposed to be a comedy.  
115,1144,9/9/2021 3:38," Never been to Oregon, but not a state I think I would want to live in with all of the rain they get. ", I think it would have been better as a comedy. I like Jack Black movies.
1021,1145,10/13/2021 16:28," Yeah, I'm not a huge fan of rainy states to be honest. ", I love them!  He cracks me up.  I like corny goofball comedy.  I used to like watching 3rd Rock from the Sun when it was on tv for that same reason.
880,1146,9/30/2021 13:45, Me either. Did you know the government of Oklahoma has an Oklahoma shaped pool?, Yeah I liked the goofy brother. Dont remember his name. I thought he was funny.
521,1147,8/31/2021 15:52," No, weird. Is a hew a professional swimmer? "," Yes.  I can picture his face, but can't remember his name either.  That show won a golden globe for best comedy series in 1997."
9,1148,9/3/2021 23:32, Do you watch many movies in the theaters?, considering the other shows that were on at the time that is surprising.
1453,1149,10/8/2021 4:25, Yes I love watching movies! Summer was considered a bad time to release a movie in the theater because of low sales until steven spielberg's jaws.," Yes.  It beat out Seinfeld, Friends, and Frasier."
657,1150,9/23/2021 11:39, Steven spielberg still makes millions from star wars off a bet with george lucas they made in 1977!, Well me personally. I would rather watch third rock any day. Those other shows were quite popular in their day though.
385,1151,10/2/2021 0:29," haha thats awesome,  I wonder what the bet was.Steven spielberg played the clarinet in the jaws soundtrack. ", Yes.  I agree.  Do you know who the highest all time box office star is?
481,1152,9/8/2021 0:41, I was wondering the same! After filming the goonies steven spielberg flew the entire cast to hawaii and surprised director richard donner with a cookout., Yeah its Tom hanks. Over 8.5 billion in the Box office. Thats a lot of money.
792,1153,9/9/2021 6:21, Amazing!  Thats so nice. When steven spielberg rode jurassic park the ride on opening day he requested that he was let off before the 84 foot drop," Holy smokes!  You're not kidding!  Did you know Disney's animation studios almost shut down after ""Sleeping Beauty"" was a box office failure?"
1000,1154,9/24/2021 1:58," Too funny! Speaking of entertainers that make a lot of money, With over $8.5 billion worldwide film earnings, tom hanks is the highest all-time box office star."," It may have flopped in the box office, but it became pretty popular after that. I would say they made a good bit of money off sleeping beauty."
1070,1155,9/18/2021 0:38, He is very talented. Disney considered shutting down their animation studio after sleeping beauty was a box office failure.," I would think so too.  However it wasn't their biggest flop.  That would have been ""Treasure Planet"" which was one of the most expensive box office flops of all time!"
1476,1156,8/27/2021 4:46," Good thing they didn't! Disney's ""treasure planet"" was one of the most expensive box office flops of all time.", I dont think I even saw that one.
1307,1157,8/27/2021 23:15," yeah,  I read that recently,  I never saw it.  The movie trojan wars with a budget of $15,000,000 has earned only $309 in box office"," I remember it, but don't remember seeing it either.  Silence of the Lambs had a box office of over $270 million and came out on Valentines Day 1991."
1334,1158,9/13/2021 9:31, Yikes! The silence of the lambs came out on valentine's day in 1991 and had a box office of over $270 million., That was a good movie. Still a classic. Have  a good one.
447,1159,10/1/2021 3:25, That movie was great and creepy at the same time.  ," Hey how is it going, you ever cook a turkey during Thanksgiving?"
1441,1160,10/5/2021 0:24, Super creepy. Spielberg became a household name as the director of Jaws.," No, the only bird I ever cook is chicken; I'm looking to expand my skillset, though! They're the most numerically successful class of tetrapods."
391,1161,9/16/2021 16:56, Did you know that More than 80 percent of the earth's natural forests have already been destroyed," Ah I gotcha, I was going to say there are some tips to maximize space in the oven during Thanksgiving, but that might just bore both of us haha. That's pretty cool about chickens, there are over 10000 birds that classify as tetrapods."
133,1162,9/9/2021 15:34, That's sad. About 71% of Earth's surface is covered with water.," I'm sure that some like hummingbirds don't lend themselves to eating, but I know that ostrich steaks are a thing; I wonder how to cook those! I guess they can be so big because they don't fly."
858,1163,10/7/2021 7:40," Also, When earth was first formed a day was only 5.5 hours long.  Such short days!  i wouldnt mind going to work for only 2 hours lol "," True, I'm surprised they still have wings. I cannot believe how small hummingbirds are, only 2 inches!"
1181,1164,9/16/2021 13:28," That would be great! If earth's entire history was viewed as a 24 hour period, humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds.", I guess they're still evolving to the point where the wings disappear. Some birds don't get that chance--the famously extinct dodo bird is actually a sub-family a pigeon that I guess didn't evolve as much as it needed to!
402,1165,9/18/2021 6:33," Mind blown!  I love these facts! In september of 2010, the united nations appointed official ambassador to extraterrestrials in they case they would ever make contact with earth"," Interesting, it's funny that hummingbirds steal spiderwebs to construct and repair their nests. That is really cool to me."
430,1166,9/20/2021 13:03, What?! Thats funny. Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago.," That's very resourceful. Some wild birds in Australia are resourceful in mimicking the human world sounds of cameras, car alarms, and chainsaw, although I'm not sure exactly what purpose that would serve."
801,1167,10/10/2021 13:55, The earth is old!  Earth will be virtually helium-free by the end of the 21st century," I've heard that, they're pretty resourceful. I didn't know how light birds were, their skeleton is hollow and weighs less than the feathers."
366,1168,10/12/2021 6:44," Wow. The majority of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice, including the Antarctic ice sheet and the sea ice of the Arctic ice pack. ", Maybe that's why some birds are able to migrate from Alaska to northern Mexico without sleeping; the light weight must keep them from getting too exhausted.
764,1169,9/27/2021 3:36, was good talking to you!," That is some cardio! They all have feathers, beaked jaws, lay eggs and have a four chambered heart, I wonder how far they are from dinosaurs."
424,1170,9/10/2021 10:22, Did you ever watch ET?," Even if they are distantly related, I bet dinosaurs didn't dance the way some birds do to impress their potential mates. They're more closely related to humans in that way."
486,1171,9/20/2021 20:42," Yes, I did.  It was the movie when I was a kid!", I bet not. At least they don't have to worry about having 4 pairs of pointe shoes a week to go through like professional ballet dancers.
77,1172,8/27/2021 11:57, Seems like Steven Spielberg is trying to return to his glory with Ready Player One. Have you seen that?," That's a lot, but I guess that kind of dancing is stressful on shoes that are supporting the weight on such as small surface. Did you know that Tupac danced ballet in high school and was even the mouse king in a production of the Nutcracker?"
571,1173,10/7/2021 9:46," No, I haven't see it.  Have you?"," I never knew that, I did know Bruce Lee was a great dancer that won a dancing championship in 1958."
378,1174,8/23/2021 3:55," I have't either. At the premiere screening the sound cut out. But instead of booing, the audience member cheers and makes their own sound effects."," That kind of makes sense, since there's so much coordinated movement in both martial arts and dance. It would be more odd if a dancer ended up being a video game pro."
1270,1175,8/29/2021 10:20," Well that was sure nice of them to do that, I'm sure Spielberg appreciated it!"," True, especially if they became a professional Tetris player lol."
1161,1176,9/18/2021 1:12," Right, usually that would be embarrassment. That was cool of the audience. Ready Player One is another childlike adventure where virtual reality dominates."," Yes, it is actually one of the three best-selling video games of all time, along with Minecraft and Wii Sports,"
502,1177,10/10/2021 0:12," It sounds cool, my grandkids would probably like it.  I remember when I first saw Jaws, it scared me to death!"," I can't believe it was made in 1984 by Alexy Pajitnov, the government owned the rights to it too."
1321,1178,9/18/2021 8:17," Yeah, I know what you mean. Ready Player one takes place on an Earth where people go to VR to escape their real life problems. I can totally imagine this happening in the future."," I guess that's a consequence of working for the Soviets. Meanwhile, the NHS in the UK actually advocates using the game for people suffering from PTSD."
851,1179,9/8/2021 10:45," OMG, goodness, alot of people would def get hooked on that! Do you watch alot of movies?"," I could see that, it helps you escape what you are feeling and what not. Could help those suffering from trauma too."
479,1180,9/13/2021 8:58, I don't really though I like Disney movies. How about you?," Yes, and research suggests that playing Tetris provides a quick fix for people struggling to stick to diets or quit smoking or drinking."
822,1181,9/11/2021 10:02," Me too, I love Disney movies.  I read that Disney considered shutting down their animation studio after Sleeping Beauty flopped."," For sure, a lot of stimulation. I am going to get going though, good talking with you, have a great weekend!"
402,1182,10/3/2021 16:13, I didn't even know that Sleeping Beauty was a flop! Treasure Planet was also a Disney movie and was the most expensive box office flops of all times., Hi there. Do you like to play video games?
1462,1183,9/8/2021 23:25, I did know that Treasure Planet was a big time flop.  I can't remember anybody that saw it saying they liked it. I read that Tom Hanks is the highest all time box office star., I used to play them when I was younger. I was never good at Tetris though even though it is one of three best selling video games of all. 
412,1184,9/10/2021 11:11, Would  you see the Silence of the Lambs on Valentine's day? That's the day it came out in 1991. It made over $270 million in box office., I was into Tetris for a while. My mom got addicted to it and stole my Gameboy a lot. I wonder if she started seeing tetris blocks in her sleep. That happens to some people who play tetris for an extended period of time.
491,1185,9/19/2021 4:53," I remember seeing it, but it wasn't on Valentine's day!", That is so weird! As an adult I wish i was good at Tetris when I quit smoking or trying to diet because it can offer a quick fix when people are struggling to stick to working on either.
132,1186,10/4/2021 18:06, Trojan Wars on the other hand ws a failure. It had a 15 million budget and earned only $309 in box office.," Yeah, and they also will regularly identify tetromino shapes in real life like in patterns on buldings or in layouts of boxes. Haha, hilarous."
164,1187,9/3/2021 18:23, That's pitiful!," Okay, well then maybe I'm not so sad that I am not good at it. I would not want to deal with that."
1051,1188,10/13/2021 5:11," Yes that is quite sad. Another sad thing is even though humans are destroying the earth, if earth's history was viewed as a 24 hour period, humans would only represent one minute and 17 seconds.", Right? Haha. I didn't know that Tetris was actually from the Soviet Union. I thought it was just part of the Tetris design where there were Russian buildings.
1167,1189,9/14/2021 4:14," Awesome, I read somewhere that when the Earth was formed a day was only 5 1/2 hours.  "," Yes, Alexey Pajitinov was the original designer and programmer."
1161,1190,8/23/2021 17:14," Wow, I can't even get enough done in 24 hours!", You mentioned that Tetris can help with addictions. Well it can also help with PTSD. So if you can deal with seeing Tetris shapes everywhere it might be a good option for PTSD.
845,1191,10/9/2021 4:06," Hi Turker, are you familiar with Steven Spielberg? "," Oh! I'm glad you're still here. I thought you were gone. Well, that is great for PTSD sufferers. "
1052,1192,9/27/2021 0:22, Hey. Steven Spielberg is one of the most popular directors. Seen so many of his films. ," No, it just takes me a while to think of what to say. Do you ever play dance video games?"
447,1193,9/29/2021 6:13," Yes you are right, have you seen E.T? if yes, did you like the movie, I know it's an old movie."," No, but I enjoy dance performances. Did you know Tupac was a ballet dancer?"
565,1194,10/1/2021 15:12," Yes it is an old movie. I like older movies. I remember when the game for the atari came out, they literally had to mass dump the product  in a field somewhere."," That is neat. Speaking of ballet dancers, they can go through four pairs of pointe shoes a week. Sounds painful and expensive!"
252,1195,9/11/2021 17:10," Yes I heard about that, but I wonder if the atari could have been recycle, just to think about all those Items were destroyed."," Yes, that does, I agree! I think its cute that babies hear music and spontaneously dance."
980,1196,10/2/2021 12:23, Yeah. its funny that he made all these movies here for all humans to see. Here on planet earth. A 4.5 million year old rock. I wonder if aliens seen our movies? ," When they hit the beat! So babies can hit the beat but it seems like a lot of us adult forget how to, haha."
1065,1197,9/1/2021 14:20," yes you are right, I really like all the Jurassic Parks, I have watched those movies several times.", I know I have a hard time! When babies hit the beat it makes them smile.
1373,1198,8/30/2021 8:25," Dude!!! Tell me about it. Its crazy that Tom hanks made so much money. Making 8,5 billion worldwide and wasnt in any of the sagas. not in star wars and not in jurassic park.", One thing that makes me smileis Michael Jackson's dance. I didn't know that to achieve lean he used a device which he patented.
1424,1199,8/27/2021 14:45," Yes Tom Hanks made a lot of money also, did you know Steven Spielberg played the clarinet in jaws?"," That was smart. those moves were pretty extreme, so that explains a lot of how it was done."
486,1200,9/4/2021 6:09," That is so cool how invlolved he is. I read that a movie named trojan wars costed $15,000,000 to make and only made $309. I need to find out what movie that is lol", Right. Bruce Lee was another great dancer. He won a Cha Cha championship.
1194,1201,9/23/2021 0:04," Wow what a loss, did you know Steven Spielberg still make millions from star wars because a bet from George Lucas in 1977?", Did he really? Where did he do that? In the USA? Sounds like he is a multi-talented guy.
292,1202,9/19/2021 13:52, Yes I read that. I did not know that he Directed The Color Purple. Saving private ryan was one of my favorites though., That was in Hong Kong.Now I want to see if there is any footage of him dancing. Have a good day!
938,1203,9/11/2021 0:30, Either me I just recently saw color purple and it still a good movie like  I have seen it for the first time., Do you like birds?  I love watching them!
279,1204,9/4/2021 8:28, You see how big Oprah is now right? She was wonderful in that movie.," I do, too! So many of them are beautiful, and even the ones that aren't are still incredibly unique. They can be anywhere between 2 inches or 9 feet!"
723,1205,8/26/2021 5:15," Yes she was, do you usually purchase your tickets from the box office or purchase online?", I think it's incredible how easily they can fly.  It's probably because their bones are so hollow that the entire skeleton weighs less than the feathers!
342,1206,9/30/2021 21:08, I always buy it online. I try to avoid missing out on big titles like star wars. Pick it up at the theatre.," Probably! Did you know one of the smallest birds, a hummingbird, will actually steal spider webs construct and repair their nests?"
230,1207,9/5/2021 17:44, Did you know that more than 80 percent of the earth natural forests already been destroyed?," That's funny!  There are wild birds in Australia that can mimic the sound of cameras, car alarms, and chainsaws. That could get noisey!"
467,1208,9/16/2021 9:32," Yeah I read that. And we continue to use our resources like we dont have a clue whats going on. If global warming hits us, think of the already 71 % water covering earth. It will be catastrophic ", Wow. I wonder if they're in the parrot family or if other birds outside of the parrot family can mimic sounds like that?
1220,1209,10/8/2021 5:44," Yes you are right, we can't see it because most of the water is underneath us. ", That's a good possibility!  The extinct dodo bird is actually a sub family of pigeon.  Interesting.
1051,1210,8/27/2021 2:49, Oooo imagine the animals in the unexplored water world we have not seen yet. 4.5 million years old and the world has animals in its oceans for quite some time now. Like the lizards. , That is interesting! Can you believe there are some birds that will migrate all the way from Alaska to Mexico without sleeping?
105,1211,9/5/2021 7:39," when the earth was first formed a day was only 5.5 hours long. It was nice chatting with you, have a good night.", That's pretty incredible!  Do you like to dance?
1029,1212,9/22/2021 22:21, Did you know that summer was considered a bad time to release a movie?," Only if I've had a couple of drinks, but I respect the art form absolutely. How about you?"
217,1213,8/31/2021 2:56, In the past it may have been. , I can't dance but wish I could.  Tupac danced ballet in high school and ended up portraying the mouse king in the Nutcracker!
22,1214,9/13/2021 4:10," Yes, it was until Jaws was released. That was a scary movie back in the day.", That's pretty impressive! Bruce Lee was also evidently a pretty good dancer. He won the Hong Kong Cha-Cha Championship in 1958!
1386,1215,8/27/2021 1:34," Yeah, that was a good movie. Did you like it? ", Wow.  I had no idea he danced but I can see that going hand in hand with the karate moves.
697,1216,9/27/2021 13:34, I use to. I think I have seen it too many times now. Spielberg played the clarinet for the soundtrack., Most definitely. Did you know babies spontaneously dance when they hear music? I guess we as humans appreciate rhythm regardless of age!
458,1217,9/11/2021 2:39," Yeah, that is pretty interesting. Did you see the Goonies? ", I didn't know that.  Professional ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week.  That could get expensive!
1197,1218,9/19/2021 4:59, I have. That is a cute movie. I love how they get the jewels at the end to pay the mortgage.," Definitely! Though I can imagine why, standing on your tip-toes so frequently with all of your body weight must be extremely taxing on shoes!"
363,1219,9/12/2021 22:12, It is pretty good. I'm fairly certain Stranger Things is a rip off of it. , Ouch!  That's all I'll say.  I would have broken toes.  Michael Jackson has a patent on a device that was used to help him achieve the extreme lean in some of his dance moves.
1096,1220,8/29/2021 5:25, I've never seen that movie. There are so many rip-offs these days.," Hey, have you ever played Tetris?"
944,1221,9/8/2021 8:52, It is a show on Netflix actually. The first season isn't that bad. ," I did back in the day.  The 3 best selling videogames of all time are Tetris, Minecraft, and Wii sports.  I had fun chatting with you!"
182,1222,9/18/2021 4:33," I don't have Netflix. These days, I'm sure that sounds weird."," You, too! I may go play some tetris, but that whole phenomenon of blocks falling in my sleep if I play too long freaks me out!"
1140,1223,9/28/2021 15:17, I don't either. I saw it at a friends house. , LOL Have a great night!
1342,1224,9/23/2021 16:56, I heard that Netflix is losing a lot of money because of password sharing. Did you know Tom Hanks is the highest all-time box office star? I would believe it., Hello! What do you enjoy doing for entertainment?
19,1225,9/15/2021 1:20," Yeah, that could be, they are creating a lot of their own content. ", I really love to cook. Thanksgiving in my favorite holiday to cook for. Planning the meal and making everything fit on my oven is like tetris.
44,1226,10/1/2021 15:59, All the streaming channels seem to be doing that now.," Yes, so do I! and I agree, Thanksgiving and Chsitmas are my favorite Holidays. and you are right especially if you only have one oven to work with like susan westmoreland says ""it's a bit like an acrobatic dance"" lol"
1166,1227,8/23/2021 6:00," Yeah, that is pretty cool. Do you use Roku? "," Great way to make a word picture, yes! I would totally agree. Planning backwards are what some experts say to do, like Susan Gage Caterers."
980,1228,8/26/2021 6:10," Yes, I love my ROKU."," haha, true! Another of my all time fav things to do would be dance! although my back doesnt like it so much. I love watching dance videos..."
1248,1229,9/8/2021 14:39, Do you recommend getting one of them? ," Oh yeah, me too!Dancing while I bake pies for Thanksgiving is an exacta. I have a guilty pleasure of dancing to ballet musicals. I read that those ballerinas go through four pairs of pointe shoes per week.!"
614,1230,10/2/2021 22:10," I would definitely. You can also get Netflick, Hulu. I have Amazon Prime which has lots of channels."," That is a daily, cooking and dancing! and ouch! 4 pairs! Oh my word, that beats my once every year. Another great dance was Michael Jackson, he had a patent on a device, I didnt know you could achieve lean in dance moves"
175,1231,8/25/2021 7:26, Oh cool. Then maybe I will check that out. Are you a Tom Hanks fan? ," Really, that is a cool fact. I liked his music even though the person is in question."
980,1232,9/4/2021 10:33, I truly am. I draw charcoal portraits and I have drawn a picture of him. He is an amazing actor. I also like Robin Williams. I noticed he did a lot of movies about dying.," True, its hard to know truth from lies in the media unfortunately, Bruce lee was also a great dancer he even won the hong kong cha-cha championship in 1958! I didnt know there was such a thing."
983,1233,9/7/2021 13:19," I think he is a great actor. Well, nice chatting with you!"," The Cha Cha winner! How cool is that, Bruce Lee was an amazing athlete all the way around. I think its so sweet how babies can spontaneously dance when they hear music.lol"
1312,1234,9/9/2021 15:51, Nice chatting with you too.," Yes, I have 2 year old twin boys and they Love to ""shake shake shake, shake your booty"" haha they crack up everytime. They love to dance and watch our birds. Do you have birds?"
292,1235,9/12/2021 14:44, Do you know much about the Bible?," How precious! lol. Oh yeah, we have many many birds that come fly into our windows, in fact. Hummingbirds steal the spider webs to construct the own nests too, thats a nice bonus for me and less cleaning too."
716,1236,10/7/2021 12:44, some yes," Wow, yes birds are amazing creatures and so light! their light bones are so hollow sometimes weighing less than their feathers. Love them."
210,1237,9/30/2021 2:11, Did you know that has sold over an estimated 5 billion copies?  Wow.," Yes, so delightful and treasured. Mine will mimic things that make me run looking for alarms sometimes.lol"
1282,1238,9/21/2021 5:23, I knew it was perhaps the most sold and published book of all time," haha, I always wondered what such distances they can fly without resting. Ive learned that some birds can fly from alaska to northern mexico without sleeping.. I wish I could fly! Vacations would be way cheaper!"
882,1239,9/10/2021 5:31, Yes. Prior to 1963 it was not uncommon for students in the US to be required to read from the bible as part of their elementary eduction!," Gosh, that's a good point and they would be a lot more affordable. I am addicted to playing tetris when I fly because it takes my mind off of flying. Tetris is proven to be a quick and manageable fix for people who are trying to stick to a diet, quit smoking or drinking. I use it for flying."
904,1240,10/8/2021 0:09, Yes I lived in the Southern US for a while and they still use that at times," Tetris! such a great game, reminds me of my youth, Its been around since ive been around lol well I guess tetris is a few years older 1984 it was created! "
872,1241,9/8/2021 8:36," Nice.  Thomas Jefferson created his own version of the Bible.  He used a razor to cut out the supernatural parts, such as the miracles and the resurrection."," Yes, mine too. It is one of three of the greatest games of all time. Minecraft and Sport Wii are the other two. The tetris game has been used to help people suffering with PTSD,also."
647,1242,9/19/2021 12:17," I was fascinated to hear about that.  That would mean he did not accept the divinity of Jesus Christ, but that He was only a human man.", Interesting! Do you know where it was created?
143,1243,10/2/2021 2:06, Yes!  Teddy Roosevelt and John Quincy Adams are the only 2 US presidents that did not use a bible when they were sworn in.," Yes, it was created in Russia by a man who almost never made any money from it but eventually he did in 1996. I must admit I had the tetris effect for a while after I played. I would see everything in blocks and a way to fit."
922,1244,10/2/2021 4:25, Yes that would indicate to me that they were agnostics or aherents to another form of religion," Wow, It was truly a great invention and it traveled such a far way... from Russia!"
313,1245,9/13/2021 0:42," Yes.  The biblical tower of Babel was likely based on a real building, the Etemenanki in modern day Iraq."," Gosh, yes it did. Over every ocean too. The franchise sold more than 495 million copies not counting all the downloads in todays time."
71,1246,10/6/2021 14:11," I did not now that, but it is certainly possible.  William Shakespeare wrote an incredible amount of material even though he died at 49 years old."," I learned so much today, Thank you. It was fun chatting with you! Hugs and much Love to you! Take care!"
835,1247,10/6/2021 16:46, Yes he did!  he is regarded ad the greatest writer in the English language!, Hi there ! Looking forward to chat with You ! ;)
891,1248,9/10/2021 16:49," I think I read the cliff notes to one of his plays, but I could never stay interested in his works!", Me too.  Would you believe it if I told you that the Chicago Cubs last won a World Series when the Ottoman Empire was still in existence?
786,1249,9/26/2021 20:24," I read the cliff notes of some of his things in college.  He coined a lot of popular phrases that we still use today like ""good riddance"" and ""wild goose chase""."," am... no, I don't think I would believe that... ;) was that in Wikipedia ? ;) lol"
62,1250,10/11/2021 10:56, Yes those sayings certainly seemed to have stuck into modern language," Maybe a saved version of wikipedia.  I won't soon forget when the Cubs really did win, back in 2016, over my Indians."
83,1251,8/31/2021 6:38, Pocahontas and Shakespeare were alive at the same time and died only a year apart.  Interesting facts., Your ? ;)  at that time You were cheering for Indians ?
953,1252,9/21/2021 5:50, I guess that would mean Lewis and Clark were exploring the Western United States while Shakespeare was performing plays in England!, Yes.  I'm not the owner of the team ;) ... they're just from my hometown.
329,1253,9/5/2021 9:10," Yes!  lol  Shakespeare invented the names Miranda, Jessica, and Olivia.  I never knew that.", Although I'm Polish - I got that ;) lol. How are they doing these days ?
1073,1254,9/22/2021 22:54," Yes, true.  His works can be found in a library, which in Greek language means ""book+shelf""."," Pretty good, on top of their division last year, but no where as good as the Red Sox.  They had an amazing start to the year, and then they won the World Series."
1056,1255,9/5/2021 23:03, I love going to libraries!  I'm a heavy user of them.  It's been fun chatting with you!," Holy crap, nice. Probably fat bonuses for everybody... but hey... if they made their fans happy, why the heck not... they earned it !"
544,1256,9/14/2021 15:20, Same thing to you. Good day.," They did.  It was almost too easy.  They have great pitchers, good hitters, and a new manager.  Normally, a new manager isn't a help, but he was from the team who won the World Series the year before, The Houston Astros."
149,1257,8/25/2021 0:16, You have a good day too!, Huh... do You think he knows a secret for winning World Series ? ;)  idk... I think it's just a well paid team ;)
1327,1258,10/10/2021 14:15, There was man who was falsely imprisoned. He used the prison library to study law and learn to free himself. That is amazing don't you think?," Money and chemistry build winning teams, if you ask me.  Baseball is popular in the US, Japan, and a few other places.  Is it played much in Poland?"
1094,1259,9/23/2021 4:24," That is awesome! Speaking of libraries, there are more libraries than McDonalds in the United States. Do you have a library card?"," Not really, but we do buy baseball bats :) to go watch soccer games on a stadium :)"
631,1260,10/2/2021 21:46," I do and that is good to hear. Also, half of adult have library cards that seems like more than I would have thought."," You buy bats?  Why?  I used to collect baseball cards, which can be quite valuable!"
1036,1261,8/30/2021 0:19," I know. I don't know that a lot of my friends go to the library. The Sacramento Library has instituted a type of library that might make going to the library more interesting to many. They started a library of things, so you can check out sewing machines and other things that you don't need to own for a long time.", well... when one soccer team meets other soccer team and those two towns/teams are not friendly... You need to take whatever You can smuggle to the stadium to fight off the hooligans from the other team ;) lol - baseball bats are selling good in Poland but nobody plays the game ;) lol
603,1262,8/23/2021 6:49, That would be so useful. I wonder if other cities do that? I know that normal library collections often included DVD's and CD's and other things besides books.," ah ... that's a little scary.  I suppose without a baseball bat, my simple weapon of choice would be  ...  something else I can't think of.  Fascinating.  I do like soccer.  I'm a Croat (half really), so the World Cup was exciting this year.  Unfortunately, only the women's world cup is more popular in the US than the baseball world series."
541,1263,9/2/2021 11:56," Yes, and I have also checked out passes to various museums in my city. I'm glad some people were dedicated to starting libraries in the past as they have been so useful to me. Have you heard of UK Prime Minister William Gladstone?", Croatia won out hearts this Worldcup - seriously - great job guys   ! It was a pleasure to watch Your matches !
1185,1264,10/9/2021 6:55," I have. I heard that he started a library in 1895 with 32,000 books in it. All from his personal collection. Can you imagine?", Do you think Modric was really the best player in the tournament?
1339,1265,9/18/2021 1:28, The more amazing thing to me is how he carted all those books by wheelbarrow over 3/4 mile. He was 85!," In the entire tournament? Maybe not the actual best, but he showed a lot of passion for sure !"
30,1266,9/16/2021 13:45," Maybe his daughter helped him. I wonder how many were Shakespeare plays. I was reading one at the library. Did you know that Shakespear coined many of the terms we use today, including ""good riddance"" and ""laughing stock?"""," Fair enough.  Do you think soccer coaches are important to the winning of a team, like they are in baseball?"
1195,1267,9/2/2021 23:24," Oh, that's interesting. I would never have thought as luck would have it, break the ice, and full circle were from Shakespeare."," they sure are, but these days with so much primadonnas in the team, I think they have a tough job to do..."
477,1268,10/6/2021 23:23," I guess it makes sense that he coined so many terms since he was the world's greatest dramatist. Plus, he wrote so much. He wrote 39 plays!"," Yes, I get the impression that soccer players are paid very much.  Baseball has some of those, but only a few total and maybe one or two on each team."
104,1269,9/12/2021 0:16," Not only did he coin terms, but he created names. The names Miranda, Olivia and Jessica were invented by Shakespeare. I didn't know those names went so far back!", Yeah.... that among some other reasons doomed our Polish team in World Cup... sad really...
1131,1270,9/20/2021 22:11, That is interesting. I wonder if these names sound different with the accent of the time. I know the accent can affect the meaning of the performance. The old accent can introduce rhymes or puns that don't work with our modern tongue. What might Miranda sound like in Shakespeare's voice?," Well, I would root for the Polish team.  I have great respect for your country."
1063,1271,8/29/2021 21:16, That is an interesting thought. Shakespeare has been translated into every major language. I wonder how they preserve Shakespeare's style and language in other languages.," as my for Yours brother ;)  what a kind thing to say, thank You ! :)"
893,1272,9/12/2021 21:53, That is a good question. It would be interesting to study that in school. I bet people use to study Shakespeare in school more than they do now. I hear that people often studied the Bible in school before 1963., Thank you.  It was nice to talk with you.
1097,1273,9/5/2021 7:53," Yes, the Bible does still play a large role in our lives though. Presidents are still sworn in with them. I wonder why Teddy Roosevelt and John Quincy Adams did not use Bibles at their swearing in ceremonies.", Would you much of a baseball fan?
1248,1274,9/13/2021 12:03," That is true. It does play a role still. Plus it was influenced by real history. For example, the tower of Babel was probably based on a real building in what is now Iraq.", A little.  I just read something about the Boston Red Sox.  They has some hard core fans.
14,1275,8/29/2021 22:51, Thomas Jefferson didn't seem to agree with all parts of the Bible. He made his own version and cut out the supernatural parts. I wonder why that was., I guess they are doing well at the moment.  they went so long without winning anything and now they can't stop.
443,1276,10/8/2021 18:49," Interesting!. All so at least three Presidents saw the Bible differently (Jefferson, Roosevelt and Adams.) Iti is interesting to think about how the Bible changes too. For example, the apple from Adam and Eve was a translation from the 4th century.", Yeah. Mookie Betts seems to really be getting some distance on his hits. 
1440,1277,10/9/2021 19:40, That's true. And different Bible canons have evolved over the century with overlapping contents but also diverging contents.," That's a new name to me, seems like a name from a Star Wars movie.  I wonder if they are the best team in baseball right now?"
1002,1278,9/4/2021 20:52," Yes. In fact, the what is seen as canonical depends on the traditions of different groups.", I really don't know.  They have a picture named Porcello that is really good.  It sounds like they have a good balance between pitching and hitting.
316,1279,9/8/2021 22:16, That is what cuases disagreement between CHristian denominations about what should be included in the canon., I'm originally from a different country but my wife is from Cleveland.  She used to get very excited in the late nineties when they had a good team.
889,1280,10/7/2021 17:48, Hi!  How much do you know about planets? , That's cool.  I guess FanGraphs estimates that the Red Sox have a 71% chance to win the division.  That's good for your wife.  What country are you from?
714,1281,9/7/2021 22:08," Hello - I know the alternate names for Earth are gaia, tellus, and telluris."," England, been here over twenty years.  Have not really got into baseball, went to a few games in the past at Camden Yard and Jacobs Field."
1374,1282,8/24/2021 15:43," That is awesome, I wonder why they settled on Earth.  It is the only one without a God/Goddess name."," Well, a very belated ""welcome"".  Are you a cricket fan?  I didn't realize that the NYT owned part of the Sox.  "
1005,1283,9/27/2021 10:16, I saw that in 1975 the Soviet Union sent a spacecraft to Venus.," I am, used to play to a fairly high level.  Isn't that sacrilege for the NYT to be involved with Boston, or are they just hedging their bets."
38,1284,10/12/2021 1:01," Wow, maybe that is how they found out it doesnt tilt/"," Yes, I had the same thought.  They are such rivals.  It's wild that baseball managers can actually play in the game.  I have never seen that."
184,1285,10/4/2021 4:18, You can fit every other planet between Earth and the moon/," I guess it's in the rules, that's why they wear the uniform.  I'd love to see one of those really old managers walk up to bat one day."
80,1286,10/10/2021 20:46," Wow, I didnt realize it was really that far away.  Does that include pluto, they can't decide about that poor planet.", Yeah.  It would be even better if that old manager knocked it out of the park.  Babe Ruth didn't look like an athlete so why not?
1457,1287,9/2/2021 17:25, I believe it does. There is a planet that orbits four stars., So who did win the world series this year?  Was it Boston or another team?
1072,1288,10/12/2021 4:00, There is a planet where shards of glass rain sideways at 4500 mph in 2000 degree F weather.  No thanks.," The Sox.  They played the LA Dodgers.  I'm actually a Royals fan and it was a bad year.  As an aside, I had no idea Babe Ruth blew a World Series by getting caught stealing in 1926.  Say it ain't so Babe!"
509,1289,8/27/2021 23:20, That's crazy! Manned space stations orbit Jupiter are impossible due to the intense radiation.," He was an exceptional player, but he doesn't strike me as someone who was quick on his feet.  New York should be able to forgive him"
1038,1290,9/19/2021 3:25, I would imagine.  I have heard there are pretty violent storms on Jupiter., I'm sure they have.  It's also hard to believe that the Cubs won back-to-back World Series games.  They have been mediocre for years.
625,1291,10/4/2021 5:00, I've heard that too. Even heard you can pick up the strong storms on Earth over radios," Guess all the curses are going away, there must be a statute of limitations on them."
513,1292,9/21/2021 19:39, Jupiter has a moon that could be considered a planet if it orbited the sun.," Ha!  Yes, the ""Curse of the Bambino"" apparently was rescinded.  The Sox won last..."
521,1293,10/12/2021 4:24, Wow that's crazy. Do you know much about governors?," Nice talking with you, Go Royals!"
510,1294,9/26/2021 1:57," Some, I know Schwarzenegger never lived in Sacramento, he commuted daily by private jet.", Do you watch baseball much?
459,1295,8/27/2021 21:57, That would be hard to do. It says he went 3 hours per day by private jet. Talk about a long commute., Yea I watch it during the world series when the AL champion faces off against the NL champion
912,1296,9/10/2021 15:42, i couldnt do that.  time is too valuable.," Nice I enjoy watching the world series, my favorite team is the Red Sox, they won it this year!"
192,1297,8/27/2021 7:34, I agree. Did you know that Athiests cannot be governor of South Carolina.," Yea, they've been pretty good, kinda crazy the NY Giants refused to play them in the 1904 world series"
1093,1298,8/29/2021 19:19," Wow, I didnt know that.  Texas actually elected the first female governor."," wow, I did not know that. Did you know the red sox have lost every game on ben afflecks birthday since 1997"
337,1299,9/4/2021 1:43, That's really good to know. The governor of Oklahoma has an Oklahoma shaped pool.," No, I guess Ben Afflecks birthday is bad luck for the Red Sox"
699,1300,10/11/2021 22:44, Nice chat!  Have a great day!, I guess so lol! Do you ever collect baseball cards?
882,1301,8/24/2021 17:51, hello do you like dance?, Yea but I never found 3 million dollars worth of cards in an attic before
608,1302,10/12/2021 0:10, I love it. Did you know Bruce Lee was a dancer too?," Me too lol, talk about retiring early, wow! I wonder what cards he found in there. Maybe a babe ruth?"
61,1303,10/4/2021 4:35, Yes pretty awesome he even won a cha -cha championship once, Possibly. It's crazy Ruth ended game 7 trying to steal home in the 1926 World Series
1172,1304,9/17/2021 15:32," Yes, same with Tupac, he was a ballet dancer too"," wow, talk about ruining it for your team! Was he a yankee at the time or a red sox, I can't remember"
1095,1305,10/6/2021 3:13," Yeah and he even was part of a nutcracker production, he was the mouse", Had to be a yankee since Ruth was playing in the 1926 world series
553,1306,9/18/2021 4:15," Nice. Ballet dancers go through tons of shoes, 4 pairs a week"," true, lol duh! Do you know why baseball managers wear uniforms?"
1076,1307,9/7/2021 1:50, Yeah must cost a lot too. Babies are good at dancing too when they hear music," Because the manager can technically play in the game, I know Pete Rose did a few times as manager"
401,1308,8/24/2021 17:15," Yeah and they smile more once they hit the beat, smart"," wow, that makes sense! I played semi pro and my manager jumped in a couple times, he was like 50 at the time!"
1122,1309,10/2/2021 16:45, Yes super sweet. Jackson had a patent on a device that improved his dance moves, That's pretty crazy. Do you know up until 2005 the MLB schedules were done by a married couple?
196,1310,10/2/2021 0:34, Nice. Do you like soundtracks?," What do you mean, they went to the games until then or they created the schedules?"
379,1311,10/6/2021 14:35," Yes I do. Did you know Spielberg, when creating the soundtrack for Jaws, played the clarinet?", They would make the schedule for all 2430 mlb games
694,1312,8/25/2021 17:03, the Brother Where Art Thou one is 8 times certified platinum, wow that would be so crazy and intense. I would like to be part of that though some day. I wonder who makes  them now. Good chatting with you!
124,1313,9/22/2021 7:51, Wow! That is impressive. Phil Collins speaks many languages and recorded the Tarzan ST in all of them.," Nice chatting with you too, I think I'm gonna try to look for old baseball cards in my attic"
618,1314,10/11/2021 4:29," Yes including german, spanish, italian, and french. Amazing"," Me too lol, or my grandpas, bye!"
773,1315,9/26/2021 13:08, I know. The track title in the Batman Begins ST is named after a genius of a bat, Do you like dogs?
198,1316,9/3/2021 8:57, Haha that is super creative. Do you ever read movie reviews?," Yes, I do.  What's your favorite breed?"
1394,1317,10/2/2021 17:53," I read them sometimes, I mostly rely on Rotten Tomatoes, and you?", I'm more of a cat person. I was surprised to read there are 12 different dog blood types and that they can donate blood to eachother. Pretty cool. 
981,1318,9/5/2021 7:49, Me too. Did you know Bay's average rating for his movies is just 38% there?," That is cool. Dogs are not colour blind, but cannot see as many different colours as humans"
807,1319,9/20/2021 10:58, Wow that low? Movies based on video games also have a low rating there too, That's interesting. Google's code of conduct mentions that they are a dog company!
1096,1320,9/16/2021 20:37, Yeah it seems. It is owned by Warner Bros," Haha, yeah.  Me too!"
654,1321,9/16/2021 19:18, Yeah they seem to have their hand on everything, Dogs and elephants are the only animals that seem to instinctively understand pointing.
400,1322,9/29/2021 12:24, Are you a fan of dance? , That's neat.  Istanbul has a vending machine that releases food and water for the city's stray dogs in exchange for recycled plastic bottles.
506,1323,8/25/2021 15:01, Sure. I find the movement very aesthetically pleasing.," Wow, that's awesome. The dog was the first species to be domesticated."
144,1324,9/18/2021 8:51, They say that babies spontaneously dance to music. I suppose that shows there's something very fundamentally human in dance., A critical step in creation of wi-fi was a byproduct of research into improving astronomy imaging
715,1325,8/24/2021 14:54, Not just human! Parrots are able to dance perfectly to music. They speculate it's tied into their ability to mimic., Interesting! Theoretical astronomy is oriented toward the development of computer or analytical models to describe astronomical objects and phenomena.
320,1326,10/6/2021 14:27," Wow, I guess everything with a heartbeat probably feels some impulse to dance. More advanced forms of dance have aesthetic and symbolic value. "," Bill nye the science guy is the executive director of the planetary society, an astronomy organization founded by the great carl sagan."
1386,1327,10/12/2021 17:09, Did you know Emilia Clarke did the funky chicken and robot dance to audition for Game of Thrones?, That's neat! Saadat shahr is a small rural community in iran nicknamed 'Astronomy Town' because of the residents' passion for stargazing.
301,1328,9/19/2021 14:13," LOL, no. Can't imagine how that would help her get the part? I do know that Bruce Lee once won a cha-cha competition in Hong Kong.", That's cool.  Didn't realize that.
732,1329,10/6/2021 2:19," That's pretty funny. Apparently, Mr. Rogers learned to breakdance on an episode."," Yeah, the town clubbed together to pay for an observatory and on special occasions all the lights are cut to improve the view of the night sky."
394,1330,10/2/2021 3:38, And rapper Tupac Shakur danced in the Nutcracker in high school. Sounds like he and Mr Rogers swapped paths along the way., The fda burned six tons of literature in an act of us censorship
226,1331,10/8/2021 7:40," Haha. Like Bill Bailey, an old tap dancer and Michael Jackson! Bill Bailey was first recorded moonwalking in 1955.", That's a shame. There is an annual literature contest that challenges writers to come up with the worst possible opening sentence to a novel.
833,1332,9/16/2021 0:33, So someone was moonwalking for anyone (literally) moon walked? ," In 1953 sir winston churchill won a nobel prize, and it was in literature, not peace."
1190,1333,10/1/2021 20:38, Ha! That's a funny way to put it. I wonder what the called it back then? Maybe if he had been wearing those ballet slippers that make drawings from the movements we could come up with a better name., I didn't know that. Literature was an olympic event from 1912 until 1952!
894,1334,8/28/2021 4:01, I hear they go through four pairs of pointe shoes a week. Lots of wear.," Architecture, literature, music, painting and sculpture were olympic events from 1912 until 1952."
139,1335,8/23/2021 22:33," Soundtracks are important in dance, as well as movies, too."," I learned a lot, Thanks for chatting! "
783,1336,9/18/2021 9:45," Yep. And some become bigger hits than the movies, such as the soundtrack to ""O, Brother, Where Art Thou?"". It went octuple platinum.", Do you like Baseball?
258,1337,8/23/2021 10:05, Alicia Keys wrote a song for the Men in Black soundtrack when she was only 16!," I do, I watch mainly during the world series times though"
1439,1338,10/10/2021 6:08," That's impressive, although I haven't heard the tune. I know that Channing Tatum got his start dancing in Step Up when he was young. Met his wife that way."," Same here, I rooted for LA since I am from Cali.  But Boston is good too."
468,1339,9/17/2021 6:57," Yeah, it's too bad about their divorce.", I always rooted for Atlanta growing up.  They were a lot more dominant then.
1197,1340,10/4/2021 20:41," It appears to have been amicable, which is nice. They still describe each other as best friends.", I rooted for the A's.  That was crazy when the A's played the SF Giants and we had the Earthquake here.  We won and got that Commisioners Trophy!
261,1341,9/26/2021 4:48, Step Up had a really fun soundtrack.," Wow, an earthquake during a game?  "
1156,1342,8/28/2021 6:31, But I think the critics hated it. I think it has 19% approval at Rotten Tomatoes., Yep.  The big one where a section of the Bay Bridge collapsed and the Marina District caught on fire.  The game was suspended for a few days but I think A's won it 4 of 4 out of 7 games possible.
18,1343,8/26/2021 18:08," Rotten Tomatoes has some pretty high standards, though. Neither Ashton Kutcher or Jennifer Love Hewitt have been in movies with a ""Fresh"" rating."," Wow.  Thats crazy.  Im from Florida, so we have hurricanes, but we have quite a bit more warning.  lol"
1314,1344,9/13/2021 23:04, Good evening!  Do you know much about Maryland's governor?, Did you know the baseball coaches wear uniforms because they can actually play if needed lol.
802,1345,10/7/2021 15:13," Not too much,  so you?  Did you know that ralph lawrence carr was the only governor to oppose the internement of japanese americans during ww2?"," Yeah, I wonder if they ever needed to step in, or it is just a tradition."
792,1346,10/4/2021 3:17," I didn't know that.  Maryland's governor, Larry Hogan, is a republican who was under some hot water for policies on climate change.", I think it is in the rule book.  It is called America's pastime but I dont know....seems like there are more NFL and NBA fans at least out here.
537,1347,10/9/2021 10:15," Thats interesting.  the beatles song""come together"" was written for 1969 governor campaign.", It does seem that way around here too.  Baseball is actually really popular in Japan.
1491,1348,9/1/2021 16:50," Larry Hogan could probably have used the support of a group like the Beatles, but I'm sure he will be ok.  At least he isn't as bad as North Dakota's in 1934 who actually seceded from the US for a short time!", I heard that often...what is weird is why Kickball is called Soccer-Baseball in canada?
1004,1349,9/10/2021 16:26, when schwarzenegger became governor of ca he commuted 3 hours everyday lol ," It kinda makes since you kick it and operate like baseball, but seems clunky as a name, in my opinion"
111,1350,10/1/2021 14:35," Maybe so he could leave the office every day and say ""I'll be back!""  ", I guess a leg subs for the bat lol.
537,1351,10/3/2021 6:49, haha good one!   , Yeah.  Did you know that the albuquerque isotopes are named after the team in the Simpsons?
990,1352,8/28/2021 2:22, Did you hear that Texas had a female governor before other states even allowed women to vote?," Smart, use a team already branded by one of the longest running shows in history.  "
665,1353,10/12/2021 7:18, Yeah thats really interesting. did you know there hasnt been a us president who wasnt a rep or dem since 1853?, It would help sell merch.  people would want some because of the show.  
1113,1354,8/24/2021 1:10," Wow!  We truly are a two party system, but don't try getting elected as president as a democrat with a beard.  So far all bearded presidents have been republican."," I don't think anyone will copy the Red Sox name, they have had it since 1901!"
1090,1355,9/6/2021 17:33," Im not excited about that,  I will never be president lol ", Thats a long time.  I heard they started wearing red socks after the team the red stockings dropped red from their uniform.
325,1356,9/11/2021 17:26, It's crazy to think that red/blue connotations for the parties isn't even 20 years old.  , I might have to watch a little baseball this season now lol.. take care
703,1357,9/30/2021 9:53," Yeah it seems like that was always the case,  but I guess not.  ", You too!  Good chat!
1063,1358,9/9/2021 0:31," The Bush's had a heck of a run with three terms.  In fact, before Trump, you'd have to go back to 1928 to find an elected republican that didn't have nixon or a bush."," Hi! Are you a fan of baseball, got any favorite sports teams?"
1316,1359,8/23/2021 20:09," Thats interesting,  do you know much about our planets?  The planet uranus rotates sideways instead of spinning. "," I like baseball, but I don't really have a favorite team. Do you?"
1171,1360,10/4/2021 2:53, Crazy!  Jupiter is so big that it has moons that would be planets if they simply orbited the sun and Jupiter.," Don't have a favorite team either but my friends are huge Red Sox fans not sure if it's because they have gone on to win nine world series championships or what but with those stats, seems like a great accomplishment."
575,1361,9/18/2021 11:52, That is cool.  there is a planet that shards of glass rain sideways at 4500 mph!!!  thats insane!, Well they have an amazing performance. Did you know Lebron James partly own the boston red sox?
1349,1362,10/5/2021 11:36, Wow.  There are some crazy planets out there.  Venus doesn't even have seasons because it doesn't tilt and rotates in a different direction than the rest of the planets that revolve around our sun.," Oh really? I didn't know that, that must be a great investment! Lots of fans have superstitions surrounding games, do you have any? "
88,1363,9/6/2021 0:27," That is really interesting. I heard that astronauts can vote from space, lol. ", Indeed. Do you like the mlb?
1008,1364,9/9/2021 15:31, Must have been an absentee ballot!  ," Not really, the only player I'm familiar with is Babe Ruth who was caught stealing to end the game and lose the world series in 1926."
1253,1365,9/16/2021 0:47," It's been fun chatting,  have a good one. "," Well it has its pros and cons. After a 17yr old female pitcher struck out babe ruth and lou gehrig, she was banned from pro baseball"
477,1366,8/26/2021 5:30, Have you ever used the Rotten Tomatoes website? I check out all the movies I'm going to watch on there first.," I wonder how that banning action would fare in today's world and society, you think it would receive negative press?"
1453,1367,9/23/2021 8:52," You know, I do to.  I feel it's better to be informed than waste my time or money without knowing.", I think it would. Most men sports leagues don't outright ban females. They usually just have very difficult requirement to meet for females like the nfl
1249,1368,9/15/2021 21:49, If I'm watching a movie at home I don't care about the reviews as much but definitely want to make sure I am getting my moneys worth at the theater.," Oh yeah, I heard about that. I wonder if thee were collectible cards and females did make it to play on the male dominant teams, would the cards be as valuable as other cards or extra valuable, like a man found three million dollars worth of cards in his grandfathers attic!"
486,1369,9/7/2021 4:17," Amen, to that.  Movie ticket prices are outrageous, nowadays.  Netflix has almost 150 movies that carry a 100% Rotten Tomatoes rating.", I guess attics are treasure troves
1461,1370,9/30/2021 14:22," I've found it has been so hard to find a movie on Netflix, I have been watching a lot of their original content lately though. Do you watch Netflix?"," For some, unless its the attic of a hoarder. I wonder whether other sports team have requirements like baseball managers where they have to wear the uniforms because they have to play if the need arises."
483,1371,10/3/2021 12:56, All the time.  It is another one of those companies created by college students.  Lol.  All I did in college was party!, I still haven't seen the manager ever play. Are managers bench players?
319,1372,9/23/2021 2:41," Yeah I didn't spend my time in college trying to make companies either, I wish I did though."," Don't think so, but some of those managers aren't in great shape to be playing on the fields, if anything, they should just forfeit the game to save the managers from embarrassment. "
1425,1373,9/20/2021 16:54," Just a random note, did you realize that Bruce Lee wa such a good dancer?"," True. i was surprised that if a player catches a ball in their hat, the opposing team gets 3 bases"
127,1374,8/26/2021 13:23," I did not, but with his athleticism and talent I am not surprised."," Yeah, I have yet to see that happen on tv nor have seen anyone attempt to do that. In Japan, baseball is also considered one of its national past time by how popular it is there."
1430,1375,8/30/2021 6:34, I know right!  He won the 1958 Cha Cha championship in Hong Kong.  I can not even picture that., I personally don't find watching baseball games to be entertaining although I do enjoy baseball. Games here are fundamental different in atmosphere as asia
1181,1376,9/25/2021 9:28, I would like to see some video of that. I have only seen a couple of his movies.," Yeah, when you have much more physical games like football and basketball, baseball and even golf can be quite boring. Even the broadcasting of the World Series is boring to me unless the marine corps did something like they did in 1992 world series where they carried the Canada Flag into the stadium and it was upside down!"
1039,1377,9/29/2021 11:32," Speaking of dancing, are you aware that Michael Jackson holds a patent on a dance device?", I wonder if it would be more exciting if the dodgers finally win a world series champion. they have more losses than any other team
734,1378,9/11/2021 21:02, I did not know that but if anyone would have one it's him., It sure has been a while since the Dodgers won. Have a good day
369,1379,9/14/2021 18:48," That's right, he was a master of dance.  This device apparently, helped him get that extreme lean that he did in some of his dances."," Hi, how are you?"
1185,1380,9/24/2021 7:44, Now that you mention it I do somewhat remember seeing how he did that. It was almost like a piece of metal that would lock into his shoe so he could almost lean 45 degrees. I believe he used it in the Smooth Criminal music video., Hi! Good!
86,1381,9/10/2021 5:00," Looked very cool, when he did it!  I heard somewhere that Tupac danced ballet.  Have you heard anything about that?", Do you enjoy baseball?
1217,1382,10/12/2021 3:46, I had heard he trained in the ballet. Did you know that the Air Jordan logo is him doing a ballet move?," I do like baseball, but I don't really follow it. How about you?"
383,1383,8/26/2021 0:12," Wow, I didn't know that!", I love it. Watch a lot of games every year and can't wait until spring training... Babe ruth was caught stealing to end game 7 and lose the 1926 world series with his team down by one run.
1459,1384,10/7/2021 2:59, A lot of athletes have used ballet and now yoga to help with flexibility and reduce injuries!," Wow, that's awesome! Who is your favorite Baseball team? I like my Az team lol"
267,1385,9/2/2021 3:43," Yes, I hear it does help tremendously.", Chicago Cubs. I'm from Chicago so... Love going to Wrigley!
347,1386,10/2/2021 22:01," I have taken yoga before but I need a few more classes before I get more flexible. It was fun chatting with you, have a great day!"," O wow, that must be fantastic! I also like the Boston Red Sox, did you know the new york times has partial ownership?"
1416,1387,9/16/2021 10:17, hello, I did. Baseball managers wear uniforms because they are technically able to play for their teams if the need arises
177,1388,9/28/2021 23:48," Hello, Michael jackson has a patent. on a device used to achieve the extreme lean in some of his dance moves", Cool and smart! The Red Sox have won 9 world series games!
924,1389,9/25/2021 14:15, That is extremely interesting actually. never knew that," That's a lot! Up until 2005, a married couple, for 24 years, scheduled all 2430 major league baseball games played each year"
211,1390,10/2/2021 13:59, I didn't either.  I guess for the song Smooth Criminal.," Really! That is a lot, crazy! I didn't know that in Canada kickball is also called soccer-baseball, interesting!"
794,1391,8/31/2021 5:51, perhaps. what article you thought was the most interesting?, A man found three million dollars worth of 1900s baseball cards in his grandfathers attic- hidden since the 1940s. 
819,1392,9/11/2021 10:00, Tupac danced ballet in high school and ended up portraying the mouse king in a production of the nutcracker.," Whoa, what a lucky find that was! Did you know the Chicago Cubs were the 1st to win back to back world series....but haven't won since....but I bet you know that!"
301,1393,10/4/2021 17:35, I found interesting the concept with rotten tomatoes. Poor people, I did. And they won in 2016 so that/s inaccurate. But it's not your fault... You've been great!
320,1394,10/9/2021 19:55," Babies spontaneously dance when they hear music, and smile more when they hit the beat.  Dance is so interesting. "," Ohh, haha sorry....So in 1992 world series the US Marine corps color guard carried the Canada flag into the stadium upside down! nuts!"
996,1395,10/10/2021 16:38," Dance truly is interesting. As for the babies dancing spontaneously when they hear music, I totally agree. My child does the same", WHAT? That's a lot disrespectful. Crazy...
1315,1396,9/1/2021 10:53, Mine do as well.  Professional ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week., Right! I don't know if that was a mistake or not....
593,1397,8/27/2021 12:38, That I certainly didn't know. She is still too little for ballet lol, I hope it was... At least it wasn't on national TV...
1207,1398,10/6/2021 6:37, Michael bay's average rotten tomatoes film rating is 38%, I hope not too! Gotta love the world series!
315,1399,8/26/2021 18:42, Quite surprising. Also Netflix has almost 150 movies with 100% rating on rotten tomatoes, Nice chatting with you.
455,1400,8/30/2021 20:29, I was just reading that.  How cool is that? I like to watch some of the stuff on Netflix., Great chatting with you too! Have a good one!
1323,1401,9/26/2021 3:13, I also like to watch movies on Netflix. Its convenient and the premium is not too high, You too
1206,1402,8/26/2021 2:53," Exactly, Spykids received a 93% fresh rating on rotten tomatoes, better than, say, lincoln or the dark knight rises."," Hey, you a fan of any sports involving hitting balls with sticks?"
706,1403,9/6/2021 18:19, true that. How about soundtracks. Any thoughts on that?, Many such games fit that description.   Golf is one I enjoy.
511,1404,10/8/2021 2:29, I didn't realize that Steven spielberg played the clarinet in the jaws soundtrack.," I like golf a lot. It's a real shame how much water is wasted per day on each course, though. It's over 300,000 gallons a day a course!"
103,1405,9/20/2021 11:54, Same here. Thought it was very interesting," True, but consider that golf courses in America combined are larger than the size of two small US states!"
888,1406,9/7/2021 6:39," No doubt.  The soundtrack to 'o brother, where art thou?' is certified 8 times platinum."," Yeah, golf must be pretty popular in that case. Did you know there exists a golf course in Dubai that uses around 4 million gallons a day? That must cost a lot of money."
281,1407,8/29/2021 10:16, yep.pretty fascinating, I suppose that comes with games that cannot and do not utilize a standardized playing area
46,1408,9/19/2021 14:11, Thanks for the chat.  It was informative., You know what games do utilize a standardized playing area? Baseball and softball. The fields are pretty similar.
850,1409,10/12/2021 19:12, same. have a good day, Interesting.    Babe Ruth was both a famous golfer and baseball player!
6,1410,9/25/2021 11:53," Thanks, you too."," Speaking of famous people who play sports, Samuel L. Jackson actually plays golf twice a week during filming of whatever he's in."
978,1411,9/3/2021 14:44, bye, Cool.    Did you know Jose canseco claims to hold the record for longest softball homerun at 622 feet
139,1412,9/27/2021 6:07, How do you like planet earth?," Woah, that's really far! Softball players don't make a lot of money. It's usually between $5,000 and $6,000."
991,1413,9/1/2021 11:53, I find the earth and the solar system very interesting!," Well, what do you expect with a game invented at the YMCA?"
422,1414,8/23/2021 0:53, It is so interesting! I love learning about planets. Like Jupiters mon Ganymede!," Softball may have been invented at the YMCA, but it's pretty much a lesser baseball, which is America's national pastime. "
1308,1415,9/19/2021 16:39," Yes, I agree! Isn't the Ganymede Jupiters own moon?"," Someone asked me about points in baseball, and I had to explain they are runs!"
1059,1416,9/5/2021 17:41," yea, it would be considered a planet if it orbited the sun, that is amazing"," Yeah, golf uses points called strokes though. Unlike baseball, less is more in golf."
489,1417,8/23/2021 22:40," Very, Did you know our planet Earth has other names besides Gaia?"," Funny how things get named - like golf uses clubs, but baseball uses a bat."
1174,1418,9/26/2021 21:50," I didn't know there were any names besides Earth, lol. I guess maybe the blue planet, what other names do you know?", Softball uses a bat as well.
1106,1419,8/29/2021 0:23, Tellus and Telluris!  very cool! This is also a planet that orbits four stars!, True.    I wonder if they called it that when they used an actual soft ball.
295,1420,10/12/2021 9:03, wow! I love learning! I think I saw once that astronomers found a planet many light years away that could sustain life, I wonder if the fact that the game used to use a soft ball but now uses a hard ball has any influence on the records.
727,1421,9/11/2021 15:16," Yes, I heard that too! Exciting!! Do you know anything about the solar asteroid belt?"," It probably does, although more important is that softball started as an indoor sport."
874,1422,9/8/2021 10:19," I do not know too much, i just know there is crazy things that happen out there, how about you?"," That is pretty important, but it's usually played outside nowadays. Baseball started outdoor and remained outdoor."
814,1423,9/16/2021 7:18," True,  its has celestial bodies called Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta!"," Probably for the best, although I wouldn't want to be outside for a 31 inning game!     Thanks for the chat!"
394,1424,10/8/2021 10:05," I need to tough up on my planet facts, you have so many! I know that five planets are visual with the naked eye in the sky", How's it going? Do you like sports?
37,1425,10/5/2021 16:18," Yes, Aren't they interesting! Do you have a favorite planet? I think mine would be Jupiter and Venus!!", Pretty good.  You?  I do like sports.  I'm glad baseball season is about to start back up!
188,1426,9/2/2021 15:56," Mine is mars, I hope we get a man on mars in my lifetime, do you think it will happen/", Did you know there is a golf course in Dubai that requires 4 million gallons of water a day? Seems like such a needless waste.
1230,1427,9/2/2021 15:35," Oh yes, Mars!! I love it too!! I hope so, There is a good chance we will. ", No I didn't but I totally agree with you.  I guess Dubai is in a desert region so they need a lot of water to keep the grass green but it still seems wrong just to play golf on it.
1391,1428,8/28/2021 18:03," I bet, the more money we spend the better our chances. We just need some brave souls that are willing to take the chance like the first time we went to space!"," Even the ones in the US only use 312k gallons a day, which is no small amount, but is much less than that one single course."
889,1429,9/13/2021 17:15," Yes, very brave!! I hope we can do that sometime soon. Are there signs of water on Mars?", Isn't Dubai mostly for the wealthy?  That could explain the excess.
1321,1430,10/3/2021 14:22, I think there have been theories of underground lakes and the potential of water. I will read up on it more. It was so nice chatting with you and getting good facts!, It actually is not even as wealthy as New York or London. It is only marketed to seem very wealthy when in reality it isn't all that much. Abu Dhabi is actually the most wealthy city in the world.
1225,1431,9/26/2021 18:10," Really, I thought there was or at least they thought so!! Yes, enjoyed chatting too!"," I didn't know that! I always thought it was Dubai. It looks like I've believed the hype.  Speaking of hype, did you know that Babe Ruth was one our most famous golfers?"
753,1432,9/15/2021 10:11, Have a great night!, He must have been much better than Micheal Jordan haha. Did you know Samuel L Jackson puts a golf clause in his contracts that allows him to play golf twice a week during production of a movie? He must really love golf.
352,1433,9/21/2021 10:05, Hi.  I guess Channig Tatum and Jenna Dewan Tatum are getting a divorce.  Sad., He really must and people must love him to allow it in his contracts!  
700,1434,9/3/2021 7:57," Yes, I read about that in the news. The things he says about it almost sound too good to be true...maybe it's sarcastic?", Did you know kickball is also called soccer-baseball in Canada? That's kind of weird.
128,1435,9/18/2021 0:34," Not sure... They were a good team.  I guess ""Step Up"" was a favorite for many.", It does sound weird.   Did you know that the ymca invented softball?
96,1436,10/8/2021 15:36," Seems like it. I never saw it, though.They are pretty talented to be good at both acting and dancing. Singing, too?"," They also invented volleyball,softball and basketball. I find it hard to believe the basketball one though, pretty sure it was around before the YMCA, I could be wrong though."
653,1437,10/5/2021 10:40," I think so, the ""Step Up"" soundtrack had high acclaim. ", I don't know. I heard somewhere that James Naismith invented basketball.  I'm not sure if he was with the ymca or not.  
1409,1438,9/8/2021 5:03, I think the movie tried to have an overall good message to be the best you can be in everything you do. Inspirational for many.," A man found 3 million dollars worth of baseball cards in his grandfathers attic, talk about a stroke of luck!"
626,1439,10/8/2021 3:52, That's refreshing... I can see why ABC Family was mentioned. ," That is lucky!  You know, I've heard that baseball is super popular in Japan.  Over there they are surprised to learn it's our national pastime."
767,1440,9/4/2021 21:45," Kids love to dance to soundtracks, too. I think they even have a few video games with dance and music"," Man as of 2014 the average salary for a pro softball player was between 5,000 and 6,000, does not sound like a good sport to become a pro in."
829,1441,9/12/2021 8:50," Yes, they do.  I didn't know Bruce Lee was also a great dancer.  I thought he just beat up bad guys. ", No it really doesn't.  It's odd that's it's so low considering softball was the first sport shown on espn.
995,1442,10/11/2021 5:46, That's really cool! I think Patrick Swayze was also a multi-talented actor dancer. He was in a very famous movie and that soundtrack is also great.," Well i would say soccer is probably the best sport to go pro in because they make more money than basketball,football,and golf combined."
405,1443,9/10/2021 3:56, I can see him but Tupac?  I guess Tupac danced ballet in high school.  How can you hide a gun in tights? ," I agree.  speaking of softball though, did you know that the longest game in college history lasted 31 innings?"
1229,1444,9/26/2021 23:01, That sounds so crazy it might even be an urban legend! Ballet dancers go through a lot of shoes in just one week. Think how their feet feel!, Wow that is crazy long. Well it was nice chatting with you. Have a good day.
760,1445,9/12/2021 18:55, Ouch!  I guess we are all dancers to some degree.  Babies naturally dance when they hear music., Good morning!  Do you watch baseball?  It can be a lucrative thing to be a fan of the game.  A man found 3 million dollars worth of baseball cards once.
449,1446,9/17/2021 15:46," I remember as kids we'd have birthday parties and dance to various Disney Soundtracks. Do they still make those, I wonder?", I am a baseball fan. I used to collect cards but I really doubt mine are worth 3 million dollars.
139,1447,9/28/2021 17:31," If they do, they are probably ""R"" rated.  Disney has changed for the worse.  I think it's great the Spielberg played clarinet in the Jaws soundtrack.", After hearing about that man I wish I had collected them.  The ones he found though were from the 1900s.  They had been stashed away since the 1940s. 
51,1448,9/17/2021 20:40," Speilberg is amazing! It wouldn't surprise me if he could dance well, too! I wonder if he'd ever play an instrument in another soundtrack?"," I could only imagine how exciting that was. My cards were from the late 1980s and 1990s, there were a lot of sets made then. I bet there were a lot less made in the 1900s."
923,1449,10/11/2021 19:40," Don't know... I do know that Phil Collins recorded the Tarzan sound track in many different languages. Ilaian, German, etc. ", I don't know actually.  The weird thing about baseball is that it's america's national pastime but it is super popular in Japan of all places.
1451,1450,10/6/2021 21:35, That's amazing! I wonder if those are all rated on Rotten Tomatoes? It's owned by WB so I wonder if it's hard on Disney or other rivals?, I know that a few countries in Asia have really taken up baseball. A lot of former MLB players play in Korea as well.
1493,1451,9/22/2021 0:07, I wonder if that biases their judgement for WB productions.  No film based on video games ever got a rating above 44% from RT., I've heard that before.  Japan likes it so much that they are actually shocked to learn that it comes from america.
372,1452,9/1/2021 19:42," If you like video games, some of those movies are pretty good, too. I didn't realize Rotten Tomatoes was started by students until recently! Brilliant!, ", That surprises me because after World War 2 they have become a lot more open to Western culture and adopting some of our styles and customs.
867,1453,9/9/2021 17:55, I kind of look at IMDB for ratings... Great chat! You were excellent!," It is surprising.  Speaking of surprising, did you know that the reason the managers wear uniforms is so they can go in the game if needed?"
1000,1454,8/28/2021 9:48," Hey do you like Star Wars? I know that I like the first three movies, the next three are ok, and I really hate the new ones", In previous years some players played a dual role as a manager as well. Now I don't think most managers would be able to last in the game.
882,1455,10/5/2021 9:21," I love the original 3 like you. But the new ones are bad, I agree. "," True, some of them look a bit out of practice.  What do you think of softball?  I didn't know it was invented by the ymca."
1158,1456,8/27/2021 14:50, Haha well I'm glad we agree on that. What did you think about Rogue one that came out in 2016? I thought it was a total disaster haha," I did not know that either. I enjoy playing softball, it is a lot more fun to play recreationally than baseball."
1215,1457,9/30/2021 23:50," I think any movie that relegates the Great Luke to the trash heap is nothing. ""No! I am your Father"" is the greatest scene of all time.", i like playing too.  What i learned recently was that it was originally invented as an indoor game though. I never knew that before!
614,1458,9/21/2021 19:44," Oh I agree with you. I just feel bad that James Earl Jones only made about eight grand for doing the voice in the first movie, although it was only about two and a half hours of work, he hit it out of the park"," I can't imagine it as an indoor game, that seems more like wiffleball to me."
304,1459,9/21/2021 18:43, Really? That is bad. Have you ever scene the scenes without him and the original actor? ," It does seem odd.  You know, it's supposed to be a faster game than regular baseball and yet the longest softball game in history went for 31 innings.  That is a long game!"
1229,1460,8/28/2021 5:40," Yes I have. Doesn't that guy have a Scottish accent or something? And I think he thought he was going to be the actual voice, very strange."," Any league I've played in always had rules to prevent that from happening! I couldn't imagine being involved for 31 innings, that's almost 3 baseball games."
290,1461,9/10/2021 7:18, Hilarious. I think they are great though. I didn't know JEJ only spent 2.5 hours recording though!, I imagine it was pretty tiring for everyone.  Softball really doesn't get as much respect as baseball even with that super long game.  Professional players only make around 5 or 6 thousand dollars a year.
681,1462,9/24/2021 14:26," Yeah I know, he did a great job for the limited time, can you believe that 20th Century Fox let George Lucas keep the merchandising rights, that's what made him a billionaire, so crazy I don't think they would do that ever again"," It's really hard to turn your sport into a major force in the US. With the popularity of the NFL, MLB, NBA, and NHL, they dominate the sports scene."
597,1463,8/28/2021 13:20," I think I can believe it. Good for him, what does the corporation need with something they didn't invent anyways?", They definitely do at that.  It's sad to think about it though because the game has been around since 1887.
848,1464,10/2/2021 6:41," No I agree with you. Are you going to watch the Academy Awards by the way? They give out 24 Awards and I think that the first broadcast was back in 1930, which is wild", At least the YMCA created basketball and therefore one of the major sports leagues around today. Not bad for a recreational game they thought up.
1470,1465,9/26/2021 16:08," Yeah, so like the academy awards totally suck. Does anyone actually give a bleep what they think?", True. They invented volleyball too.
471,1466,9/18/2021 16:19," No I think that they don't really pick the best movies. A lot of good movies that I like a lot or never even nominated. I do like Daniel Day-Lewis though, I'm glad that he won three times for best actor", hi how are you? do you like sports?
593,1467,10/5/2021 8:24," By the way, do you watch you tube? Much better than AA!"," I'm doing very well, thanks. I love sports"
317,1468,9/23/2021 3:38, Yes I agree with you! I watch YouTube almost everyday. I can't believe that Google bought YouTube for 1.65 billion dollars back in 2006. That seems like so long ago, do you like golf? i have never played golf.
1245,1469,8/30/2021 5:26," Oh, I can believe it. Google could make it a success, Youtube couldn't succeed on it own. ", I love golf. Its a great sport where individual players hit balls with clubs into a series of holes on a golf course in as few strokes as possible.
1484,1470,9/11/2021 1:06," Yep I agree with you. Did you know that YouTube is the second biggest search engine, I assume that Google is the first", I never played because it looked expensive. How long have you played?
487,1471,9/3/2021 2:12, I'm surprised it isn't the first to be honest! , I have been playing for about 10 years now and another thing I wanted to mention that the golf course consists of 18 holes but if you play the game for fun its usually 9 holes.
1404,1472,8/25/2021 22:34, Yeah I know that everyone uses YouTube do you ever watch the music video for Gangnam Style by the way. That is one of the highest viewed videos on youtube," Ok, but doesnt it cost a lot for the equipment and the greens fees and stuff?"
1248,1473,9/25/2021 16:51," No, but I have watched it. Good song, good short term fad too!", Well that depends on the equipment you buy and also where you play.
1402,1474,8/25/2021 7:42," Yep it was definitely a fad haha. So was Justin Bieber song Baby, I don't think it should be the most disliked video on YouTube, but it's definitely annoying", I guess i would want the cheapest stuff. i played sports with minimal equipment growing up.
887,1475,9/8/2021 14:11," Hello there, so have you seen any of the Star Wars movies?"," The gold course requires a lot of water to maintain about 312,000 gallons in fact per day."
1078,1476,9/2/2021 4:41, I have seen several. I read Tran who played rose left Instagram after racist messages from fans.," That sounds like quite a bit. it is ok in some places, but maybe where water is scarce, it is not ideal."
873,1477,10/9/2021 22:07," That is so sad fans are so cruel to people.  I have yet to see her in that movie, I really want to though. "," This is just the average for American golf courses. I read somewhere that a golf course in Dubai requires 4,000,000 gallons of water per day to maintain."
363,1478,9/18/2021 7:38, Me too. The last Jedi divided it's fans," That is insane. in a desert country? it seems excessive, but i guess that the rich have the money for that kind of hobby."
681,1479,9/26/2021 7:18, Yeah I think each movie does because there are so many of them and they all have their different tastes.  But the personal comments to the actors is just stupid. , I agree. Do you know any famous baseball player that is also a very famous golfer?
447,1480,9/10/2021 3:05, Did you know Chloe Bennet changed her last name to get in to US easier, Is this a recent player? i know that a lot of them play gofl.
315,1481,10/8/2021 8:40," No I didn't know that, I wonder how many people do that when they come here.  ", No this baseball player was back in the 1920s.
375,1482,9/19/2021 18:42, Seems like a lot. Apparently they get more call backs with American last names., The babe? Did he play golf? He could hit a ball pretty fall.
1180,1483,9/11/2021 17:26," Yeah I can see that, and whatever helps for them I'm sure they will do.  Hey do you know how much James Earl Jones was paid for doing all the darth vader lines? "," You guessed it correctly. Babe Ruth, he was a fantastic baseball player and at one point America's most famous golfer."
1175,1484,9/13/2021 14:10, No. What is it?," That is amazing. he was a big fellow though. i bet he could drive it pretty far. Anyway, great chat!"
998,1485,9/21/2021 2:55," I guess he only got paid $7,500, but when I say only, it only took him two and a half hours to do them!", Yes he was. It was nice chatting with you as well. Have a nice night!!!
414,1486,10/2/2021 14:29, That's a lot for 2 and half hours.in 2018 star wars was worth $65 billion, You too! Have a nice weekend!
1247,1487,9/1/2021 15:28," Holy cow, I wonder how much it was worth in 1998, probably less than half of that. ", you have a nice weekend as well. 
791,1488,10/11/2021 19:48," In 2013 star wars was dubbed in Navajo, making it the first major film to be in navajo", Thanks!
479,1489,9/8/2021 8:28, That is awesome!  Did you know Star Wars holds a Guinness World Record title?, Bye!!!
1463,1490,10/10/2021 18:08, No for what? Fox thought star wars would flop, Do you watch the show Fixer Upper?
868,1491,10/2/2021 17:18, I guess they hold the record for most successful film merchandising franchise.  When I hear merchandising I think of that scene from Spaceballs. ," Hello, I do. What about you?"
573,1492,9/26/2021 15:35, Do you watch the academy awards? Eminem has more Oscars than Leonardo DiCaprio, I have yes. They are having another baby
565,1493,9/23/2021 19:50, That is crazy!  I heard he has more than Johnny Depp and Will Smith as well. , That's pretty cool. Do you like attending concerts?
909,1494,9/5/2021 10:57, The Oscars were nominated for 9 Emmys in 2013., I do. I would love to go to a show at an old roman amphitheater
1125,1495,9/28/2021 15:57," What? That is so stupid to me, why an awards show?  Do you know who is the only actor to win best actor 3 times?", That would be very cool to see. Did you know Linkin Park played 324 concerts back in 2001?
1123,1496,9/29/2021 2:55, Daniel day Lewis I think., Thats a lot of shows. They were very popular when they first hit the scene
232,1497,9/3/2021 20:51," Good call!  He is a great actor though so I can see it, I wonder what roles he won for.  Maybe the butcher role in Gangs of New York. ", I agree. I love Linkin Park. What about you?
1004,1498,8/28/2021 23:42, Probably. Blazing saddles was nomonanom for 3 Oscars too. Well have a great night., I do as well. Sad about chester
368,1499,9/4/2021 12:37," Hello, do you like Star Wars?", I agree. Such a waste of talent to go out like that.
809,1500,10/2/2021 9:25, I don't really though I do respect it as a franchise. How about you?, Just like the waste during a 2002 concert. Creed was sued because it was so bad
1257,1501,8/27/2021 16:05, Yeah I like it. Lucas' wife made such changes to the script that she won the Academy Award, That's funny they were sued. I bet it was very bad.
1160,1502,9/11/2021 15:57," Star Wars is the second highest grossing film series of all time. It's spawned into a bunch of other media like books, video games, theme parks.", Are there any artist that you would like to see live?
1112,1503,9/12/2021 20:10, Yeah it has certainly taken over everything. It was even dubbed in Navajo, I would love to see Pink Floyd. What about you?
966,1504,8/26/2021 23:08, Cool! James Cameron decided to quit being a truck driver so that he could enter the film industry after watching Star Wars. I guess that was the right decision., Eminem is on my bucket list. He made kanye rewrite his part in a song after hearing eminems verse
785,1505,8/26/2021 23:11," Oh for sure it was, the guy is a legend now. James Earl Jones got only $7500 recording Darth Vader's lines", It would be very cool to see Eminem. The Ramones played 2263 concerts in 20 years.
383,1506,9/25/2021 15:18, Crazy! Fox thought Star Wars was going to flop and agreed to George Lucas's proposition to forgo an extra $500K directing fee so that he could keep licensing and merchandising rights. Their decision cost them billions of dollars, That must of taken a toll on them. 20 years non stop
107,1507,9/18/2021 10:41, Yeah and at the same time made Lucas a billionaire. He just had a lot of confidence in his work, I bet. Do you like Drake?
794,1508,8/23/2021 8:10," Yeah, in 2018 the whole Star Wars franchise was estimated at $65 billion", He is ok. Makes good club music
316,1509,9/24/2021 13:29, That is insane. Do you watch the Academy Awards?, I agree. Not music I would listen to on a daily basis.
1311,1510,9/6/2021 2:40," No, I don't. How about you?", Did you know he didnt graduate high school until 25?
710,1511,9/10/2021 14:59, I watch it sometimes. Did you know Daniel Day-Lewis has won the Oscar 3 times?," I did not know that. Very interesting. Well, it was good chatting with you."
421,1512,9/15/2021 12:32, I am not sure I even know who he is. Good for him. John Williams has been nominated for more Oscars than anyone besides Walt Disney.," Hello, do you like Drake as a singer?"
131,1513,10/3/2021 17:53, Yeah Disney is going to be hard to reach by anyone else with 22 Oscars," Hey there, yes he is okay. Do you know his real name?"
1479,1514,9/25/2021 1:26, He got a special Oscar in 1938 for snow white that had a regular sized statuette and seven miniature oscars. , Yes it is Aubrey Drake Graham and he is a Canadian
1228,1515,9/17/2021 16:03, That is amazing. Eminem has more Oscars than Leonardo DiCaprio and some other big names. , Yes he is. He graduate high school at 25
807,1516,10/6/2021 13:44," Speaking of Oscars, Kelly Marie Tran went to them. She is the first non white woman in Star Wars leading role.", Better late than never I guess. He also seems to be a lot into kids books like winnie the phooh and charlotte's web
271,1517,8/25/2021 5:06, That is amazing. Have you seen the movie Blazing Saddles?, Yeah I wonder who it was for though. Did you know the beat from hotline bling is sampled?
276,1518,10/1/2021 22:34, I have not seen it. Tran faced a lot of racist and abusive language on her social media though. That's sad., Oh yeah heard that it was sampled from Why we can't live together of TImmy THomas
506,1519,9/27/2021 21:08, That is just sad. I hope we move towards behaving as we should with each other. Nice chat :)," Yeah pretty cool, that song was out before Drake was born back in 1972"
1282,1520,9/22/2021 2:21, Hi there!  Are you a Star Wars fan?, Yeah exactly. Once he visited Drake University in the middle of the night when the students did not expect it
22,1521,9/15/2021 3:55," Hi, Yes I am a star wars fan!!! Since I was a kid. What about you?", Wow that must have been awesome for them. Do you go to concerts much?
771,1522,9/9/2021 7:38, Yes!  Mostly when it comes to the Original trilogy.  Those are the best.," I do from time to time. In 2001 Linkin Park played 324 concerts alone, mind blowing"
649,1523,9/20/2021 23:27," It is amazing how star wars was created long time ago , in 1977 and with a movie made last year , the star wars fever is so alive!", When did they rest? Wow that is pretty amazing. THe Ramon toured for 20 years too
1488,1524,10/7/2021 14:25, It has to be one of the most sucessful franchises ever.  40 years and still has a great following.," Right, and they played a staggering 2263 concerts during that time"
156,1525,9/19/2021 9:11," It is incredible that the first eight films were nominated for academy awards, they were able to  create wonderful productions!"," WOw, those guys honestly. In Craotia there is an ancient theater that is still used for concerts"
342,1526,9/14/2021 16:13, The total value of the franchise was about $65 billion.  It will definitely always be a legend!, Hmm sounds like the one PInk FLoyd used in Pompeii for a concert without an audience
569,1527,9/18/2021 16:57, And 20 century fox though star wars was going to be a failure!!," What a waste, I would have liked to be there for sure. Creed concerts was really bad though that they got sued"
672,1528,9/6/2021 23:26," I heard that, apparently so did Harrison Ford, I heard he didnt want to be credited in the film initially.", Wow must have been really bad then. DO you ever shop at target?
617,1529,10/11/2021 17:21," Is that right! Well, good for George Lucas because this poor vision from 20 century made him a billionaire", Yes quite a bit. They will match Amazon prices so it makes it a good place to shop
316,1530,9/28/2021 18:35, It definitely did.  Do you know how much James Earl Jones was paid to record Darth Vader's lines?, Nice I did not know that. There is no Target in Vermont though
1091,1531,10/9/2021 14:45," I believe it was $7,500, and he just spent 2 hours and a half doing so", SO I guess they have to stick with Amazon. And they do not carry tobacco products since 19
195,1532,8/29/2021 16:36," Isnt that crazy?  Some of those lines are so iconic, and he got so little for them.  Shame.", Hmm so I guess not a good spot for smokers either
633,1533,10/6/2021 18:09," I agree, it is basically nothing.. Did you know George Luca's wife influenced the star wars movies a lot?", do you go to concerts?
1147,1534,10/5/2021 1:20," Yeah, didnt she receive an editing award too?"," I go when I can, how about you?"
157,1535,9/26/2021 15:44, She got an award for editing!! I think she made an important contribution.. good job, Me too. Did you know Linkin Park played 324 concerts in 2001?
681,1536,9/10/2021 23:11, She definitely changed some parts significantly.  It would have been far different without her., Wow that is amazing. How did they have time to rest?
1032,1537,9/24/2021 12:47," Yes, she did major changes.. and is interesting George did not get the award for directing!", Exactly. The ramones also toured for 20 years straight
507,1538,8/26/2021 6:15, Eminem has more oscars than George Lucas!  That is hard to believe!, WOw that is amazing. Did you know ABBA turned down an offer to have a reunion?
171,1539,8/25/2021 8:24," Wow, and he has won more awards than Leo Di Caprio, Johnny Depp and Bill murray combined"," Yeah they played 2263 concerts during that time. They did, why?"
157,1540,9/2/2021 12:24," I didnt realized he had any at all, I wonder what they were all for."," Wow amazing. Yes, they turned down a $1 billion offer"
867,1541,9/22/2021 14:13," Have to check!! Do you know who has won , best actor 3 times?", WOw. A Creed concert was really bad that people sued them once
842,1542,8/28/2021 19:25, Who?  Harrison Ford?, That is too bad. DO you like Drake?
653,1543,9/17/2021 3:00," It is Daniel Day Lewis, what an accomplishment", I like him somewhat. Do you know when he graduated high school?
314,1544,9/20/2021 18:13," It really is!  It has been great chatting, but I must go.  have a great night!"," Hmm I am not sure actually, was it recent?"
1010,1545,9/6/2021 13:25, You do the same!!," Yes pretty recent, it was in 2012 when he was 25"
1468,1546,8/29/2021 9:46, Government is fascinating. It seems so different the world over yet there are common threads in every type. ," Yeah better late than never I guess for him, he was busy otherwise"
1188,1547,9/9/2021 2:21," I agree. Some governments try to help, others, not so much.", True . DO you know his real name or full name?
626,1548,8/30/2021 22:11, So true. I wonder what america would look like if we had a PM instead of a president. A PM seems to be held more accountable for their actions. , Yes his name is Aubrey Drake Graham and he is Canadian
626,1549,9/7/2021 3:03, True. Much easier to remove. Australia's PM position isn't in the constitution and exists only through custom. That seems strange to me. Not in the Constitution?, Yeah. Did you know the beat for Hotline Bling is sampled?
482,1550,10/7/2021 7:52, Australia's constitution is weird though. It doesn't protect the people as much like an american one does. ," Did not know that, from which song?"
1453,1551,9/5/2021 9:38, I did not know that. Number 10 Downing Street has a cat with a title! I wonder how many other government headquarters have animals like that., It is the song WHy can;t we live together?
91,1552,8/31/2021 2:45, With all the historic buildings in the UK I could see why they need one. Older structures like that tend to attract rodents. , Nice. Did you know he was in Degrassi?
820,1553,9/30/2021 4:06, Is one cat enough though? Might need a support staff.," Did not know that, pretty cool an actor as well. Nice chatting with you"
471,1554,9/18/2021 23:35, Right? lol. I wonder if you can meet the cat if you tour the offices?," Same here, have a good one."
1359,1555,8/30/2021 20:53, The cat doesn't take visitors without an appointment.," Hello there, do you attend many concerts these days?"
705,1556,9/16/2021 8:23, I could see the cat being involved in a lot of the pranks the UK officials seem to play on each other. ," Nope. More of a TV watcher. But know a little about the fabulously successful rapper, Drake Graham, or Drake, from Canada. Heard of him?"
1076,1557,8/23/2021 3:32," When you turn 100 in japan, the PM gives you a silver cup to celebrate. Too many people are turning 100 so that they had to find a way to make cheaper cups. Maybe give the cup when people turn 200?"," Yeah I have heard of him, he has made some good songs.  Do you know what age he graduated high school?"
1170,1558,9/13/2021 14:22, That would be one way to cut the costs. How many people are turning 100 that it is costing enough to have to find a cheaper solution? Talk about a healthy society. ," They say age 25. I'm guessing that he may have received a GED.  He's been in show business, first, a TV series called Degrassi: The Next Generation, ever since Drake was a 14 year old. Maybe dropped out of school in about 9th grade?"
1205,1559,8/28/2021 9:41," Yeah. Celebrating a centennial is cool, but the gov't can't afford it! Are you a fan of Johnny Depp?"," Yeah what I think is that he started so young he didn't have time to finish, but eventually did a GED type program.  I'm sure he is more than smart enough. "
1185,1560,10/7/2021 4:03, I find him very interesting. He is one of those chameleon actors that you never watch and go Oh that's Johnny Depp he sort of absorbs the character. ," Absolutely. I'd say the guy found his calling in the music industry, especially rap. He's also written songs, produced albums and become a savvy entrepreneur, they say. Not just your average Next Generation kid!"
659,1561,8/23/2021 19:28, Johnny  is producing and maybe starring in a biopic about  Dr. Seuss. I would be interested in that.," No, he is not, I know he has won multiple grammys as well!"
266,1562,9/21/2021 0:14, I think he would make a fantastic Dr. Seuss Look what an amazing job he did with willy wonka. I think the creepy edge he gave to the character was perfect. ," Yes, earned his 2st Grammy in 2011, and has earned more for Best Rap/Sung Performance and Best Rap Album."
1179,1563,9/18/2021 17:55," He is really dedicated to his craft. Edward Scissorhands was an odd film, but he made it work.", That is very impressive.  Did you know he once sampled a Timmy Thomas hit?
1415,1564,9/13/2021 0:09, That whole movie was just weird. He might be a strange man but he seems to really have a good heart. ," No. As I mentioned, I'm more of a TV watcher. Although I'm not into reality TV much, one show I'll miss that's recently concluded after 5 seasons on HGTV is Fixer Upper. Ever see it?"
1066,1565,9/26/2021 20:17, I know that he often visits children in the hospital dressed up as a pirate.," No thats not one that I have seen before, is it pretty good?"
1053,1566,9/11/2021 20:24, He seems to really be an animal lover too. ," It was, actually. Chip and Joanna Gaines, a conservative evangelical couple from Texas, who did not impose their religious beliefs on TV audiences, but were clearly sincere down-home folks, took houses needed fixing and turned them into dream homes for clients. It was heartwarming, and the couple were fun-loving."
1041,1567,9/20/2021 2:00," Many people like to watch horror films, I don't like slashers but like some like World War Z, did you know the horror film genre has been around for more than a century?"," That sounds pretty entertaining, I might have to check it out when I can. "
728,1568,8/31/2021 9:32," oh yes, I even watched the first ""Nosferatu"" movie - not sure when that was made but it's quite old..."," You'll have to catch back episodes from their 5 seasons (2013 to 2018). Recently they welcomed their 5th child, and ended the show, they said, to put their family 1st again. There's a whole genre of fix-up shows, PBS, on TV today. Who knew?"
401,1569,8/25/2021 16:13," That one is a  classic, based on the book by Bram Stoker.  They say if you watch a horror movie you will enjoy abstract art more, maybe because they are both a horror?"," Well I can respect them making that decision, I'm sure it's best for their family. "
640,1570,8/27/2021 23:51, I always loved horror movies... they work good on Your imagination ;)," Agreed. Sorry, I meant to say that there's a whole genre of fix-it shows, all of which stem from This Old House, now on PBS, on several networks, including HGTV, today."
480,1571,9/18/2021 12:16," They are good for your health as well, guess why?"," Oh ok, yeah I think I have heard of some of those shows before as well. "
571,1572,9/9/2021 11:22, Horrors good for Your health ? You poop more often ? I don't know ;)," If you want to see more of the Gaines couples work, they're written best-selling books and have a home goods line featured at Target stores. Have a Target reasonably close to you? Do you shop there?"
1302,1573,10/6/2021 21:32," Ha, that or have a heart attack, no seriously, you burn 180 calories watching a horror movie, wonder what other types of cinema burn?"," Yeah we do have a Target in town, I think I will check that out, thanks!"
1249,1574,10/2/2021 22:44," I mean if the movie really scares You, than maybe, but what if You just like the story, but it's no longer scary for You, because You've seen it all ? ;)"," I know Target well because I witnessed their growth from one location in the Roseville Shopping Center in the suburban Twin Cities of St. Paul and Minneapolis, MN to Target becoming the 8th-largest US retail department store today. Ever heard about Target's history?"
675,1575,10/6/2021 12:10," I can't imagine not being scared watching a horror movie, thats why I like other forms of cinema.  Do you know cinematogrrpahy is the science of motion picture photography and important to all types of movies?"," No, I can't say I know a whole lot about that.  But, it's been nice chatting with you today, I hope you have a good day!"
485,1576,9/10/2021 22:32," well sure, it's just hundreds of pictures with sound in the background ;)"," I am sure that you know that Black Panther is a Marvel Comics character, right?"
1423,1577,9/4/2021 3:34," The art is making them look good with the right music and sound to tell a story.  Do youknow the guy who pioneered the use of the wide angle lens won aan oscar but was not a citizen until '43 and illegally married a white woman because he was Chinese American, we have done some stupid things in our past treatment of others.", The richest superhero. Worth $500 billion.
780,1578,9/11/2021 19:31," I mean I wouldn't say it's stupid... if he was here illegally, that means he broke the law... there was no legal way to get here ?", That's the one!  The origins of the script for the movie date back to the 4th century.
1467,1579,9/14/2021 22:29," He was her and became a citizen, the law he broke was marrying a white woman because he was asian. That is crazy.", The character was not named after the black panther party.
1261,1580,10/13/2021 12:03," ahhh, I did not get that. So he came it legally ? and he couldn't marry white woman ? Was that a law ? What year was that ??", No.  LOL.  Caught me off guard with that.  The old script was written in Nigeria.
503,1581,9/21/2021 22:58," His marriage did not become legal until 1948, prior to that it was considered illegal.  No woman has every been nominated for best cinematography Oscars either, so I guess there are still some issues.", Chadwick Boseman played the character Black Panther.
1493,1582,9/20/2021 9:33, There will always be issues with race... but we're getting there..., The film was sure a block buster.  Apparently Denzel Washington helped him get his education.
566,1583,9/26/2021 12:56, I like the fantasy escape from all of our problems we find at the box office.  I guess others do to since Tom Hanks has made over 8.5 billion., Supporting his training at Oxford.
194,1584,9/16/2021 17:27," I mean good for him, he was always very talented, but honestly, I don't remember seeing any new movie with him, do You ?"," I see.  To change the subject, did you know that over 80 of the earth's forest have been destroyed in the history of our planet?"
588,1585,10/1/2021 23:48," I haven't seen anything new in a long time,  I did love Forest Gump, and You've got Mail though.  I really like Disney movies, do you know Sleeping Beauty was such a failure they considered closing down.", I believe it. We need the land for farming and people want the lumber.
405,1586,8/27/2021 1:24," lol, no I didn't know that. I have a beef with Disney thou... I loved it when I was a kid, but since they've destroyed Star Wars... they're dead to me ;)"," Yes.  I heard that when the Europeans discovered North America, a squirrel could go from coast to coast without touching the ground. Now we expect to have no helium left on earth is less than 82 years."
1303,1587,9/8/2021 14:12," I prefer the original 3 from my childhood in the 70's.  Hopefully they learn something from their flops like Treasure planet, not that was a waste of money.", I wonder if the aliens will need the helium when they finally settle on our planet. The UN now has an ambassador for extraterrestrials.
720,1588,9/4/2021 16:50," yes. just because its Disney and it has to be ok for kids ? make a division for adults and start making decent movies... You have the budget, technicians... nothing would stop them..."," Unless there really is ""warp speed"" I think it will take aliens too long to get here.  I did hear about that ambassador being appointed in 2010."
424,1589,9/11/2021 11:40, I think they have a separate division but can't remember what it is called.  I'm not sure I'd like to see the name Disney on a film like Silence of the Lambs though., The earth covered mostly with water in the form of oceans. I think that the aliens might want our planet for the water.
596,1590,9/28/2021 22:32, Why not... it was a great movie. Classic. but I see what You 're saying. No I mean make movies like Star Wars for a little bit mature audience... don't focus on 6year olds because there are millions of 60 year old wanted to see how the story continues...," Could be.  But if they don't have any they won't know that they find it useful.  Fortunately for sea levels, both of our poles are covered with ice."
277,1591,10/12/2021 5:55, We never get to see the rebuilding of the galaxy and having Leia and Han's son kill Han and be bad was a stupid thing to do., Do you read non-fiction? It's fascinating stuff.
791,1592,9/14/2021 20:43, it was a poor choice yes. and the way they showed Luke was not to my liking either...," I have read quite a bit.  I like Grisham and Clancy.  But I also like the best selling non-fiction book, the Bible."
793,1593,9/7/2021 5:18," They made him seem like he regressed into some kind of whiney baby, at his age and experience he should be evolving more like Ben Kenobi or even Yoda, not woah is me I need a xanex Luke"," Jack London lived as a poor person in London, and wrote a book about it."
837,1594,9/1/2021 1:59," That's my point exactly ! He was Vader's son ! Son of a person born out of force.. in my mind, he should be leading everybody to defeat Siths OR maybe share the faith of his father and go the the dark side... but not this...", It is hard to write about things one has not experienced.  That is why Grisham's books are about the law.  George W Bush reading 14 biographies of Lincoln is a person trying hard to do well.
1498,1595,9/22/2021 2:06," It was so frustrating and annoying.  Vader's turn to the bright side at the end should have affirmed him and gave him deterination to continue, and why have Han's son be so bad, that is just pointless,  I guess they couldn't think of a bad guy.", He also read a lot of nonfiction. Good way to get an education. No need for school. 
1234,1596,9/19/2021 16:11, I think they are preparing a twist of action nobody is suspecting but I think it's in a bad taste. I personally think Han Solo lives ;), I agree.  Education should continue through one's life.  Who would have thought that one of only 8 people to have both a fiction and non-fiction best seller would be a country singer?
187,1597,9/10/2021 0:26," I won't even pay to see the rest of them,  the cinematography is great though."," A man of many talents! Well, I enjoyed chatting!"
247,1598,9/24/2021 0:01, Absolutely ;) no argument here ;)," Me too, nice chat."
207,1599,9/26/2021 9:11," If I was a better cinematographer, I'd make my own movies, but thats not in the cards.  Its been nice visiting with you."," Hello there, did you see the Black Panther film that was recently in theaters?"
247,1600,8/30/2021 1:30," Same here, thank You so much for fun conversation ! ;)"," Yea, I think Chawick Boseman did a great job as T'Challa"
337,1601,10/2/2021 8:04, Hey there what do you know about the prime minister of the UK?, I have yet to see the movie but I heard that he did a really good job as well. 
559,1602,9/18/2021 22:41, I don't know that much actually. He has a cat though. , Ryan Coogler did an awesome job directing Black Panther and Michael B Jordan was good too
6,1603,9/24/2021 7:15, I love the name of the cat. The name is Chief Mouser of the cabinet office LOL can't say I like cats though haha, I heard the same thing.  I guess the black panther is the richest superhero there is as well. 
124,1604,9/14/2021 12:22, Hilarious. What happens if someone is allergic? ," Yea, apparently Black Panther is worth more than Tony Stark and Bruce Wayne combined"
800,1605,9/26/2021 13:26, I am actually allergic to cats. And that's a great question haha do you know who Helena Bonham Carter is?, That is crazy! I never knew there was one that had more money than those guys. 
198,1606,8/24/2021 21:28," yeah, she was in Fight Club, other than that I don't remember many of the movies with her. "," Yea, in the comics Black Panther is worth 500 billion dollars"
658,1607,9/22/2021 23:34, Apparently she's related to the prime minister of the United Kingdom during World War I. That's very bizarre, Did you know that some of the symbols and written scripts used in the movie were based on actual script dating back to the 4th century?
1197,1608,9/26/2021 8:10, Really? That is pretty weird. Did you know if you hit 100 in japan they give you a silver cup? ," Yea, based on Nsibdi from the Nigeria region"
810,1609,9/20/2021 0:06, I did not know that. It's funny that so many people turned 100 they had to find a way to make cheaper cups though haha," I think that is very cool, I always like it when those types of movies use actual history references. "
773,1610,10/1/2021 2:10," Hilarious, at least they are healthy there. "," Yea but it's unfortunate that they censored the phrase ""praise hanuman"" from the indian release of Black Panther"
373,1611,10/13/2021 8:15, That's true they're definitely not giving those Awards away in the United States haha. I do like that Norway donated a billion dollars to save the Amazon rainforest though that's very nice of them," That sounds really stupid to me, that overly pc stuff has gotten a bit too much for me. "
224,1612,8/23/2021 12:58," Yeah, that seems interesting, do they do a lot of business there? ", The Indians weren't happy they censored it either and thought it was empowering rather than insulting
1135,1613,9/24/2021 5:55, I'm not sure actually. They might have just donated it because they're nice. Unlike The guy who sold the Eiffel Tower twice who definitely just wanted the money haha, Yeah and I don't blame them for feeling that way to be honest. 
801,1614,9/25/2021 8:36," That's hilarious, he wasn't even the owner. Did you know Johnny Depp directed the film brave? "," Yea people can be sensitive over trivial stuff instead of important things, like 80% of natural forests being destroyed"
830,1615,9/3/2021 16:49, Oh I didn't know that. Have you seen that movie is it any good?," Exactly, that is so alarming and people are more concerned with silly stuff. "
485,1616,9/3/2021 17:15," I haven't actually. LOL BTW, apparently 86% of the land in Nevada is owned by the US Government. ", Yea like the UN appointing an official ambassador to extraterrestrials 
1057,1617,9/12/2021 10:04, Wow that is a lot. Very strange that Johnny Depp is making a movie about dr suess. But I think he would be great for the role," That too, I wonder how much the salary is for that job?"
746,1618,9/1/2021 6:23," I think that may have already have been released, but maybe I am wrong. "," Too much, I'm pretty worried the earth will be helium free by the end of the century"
1394,1619,10/1/2021 17:22, It does sound familiar. Have you seen the movie Edward Scissorhands? Apparently Johnny Depp only says about 200 words," Yeah I wonder what all the party balloon companies will do to survive.  Anyways, it's been nice talking with you, I hope you have a good day!"
1210,1620,9/18/2021 20:40," It's been a very long time, but yeah I saw it. Now that I think about it, he barely speaks in that film! ", Hello. Its pretty cold today. It makes me wonder whether more of the earth's polar regions are covered with ice today. 
819,1621,10/4/2021 1:46, You're right. I do love that movie a lot though. It's a great winter movie. Johnny Depp seems like a nice guy. He adopted his one-eyed horse from the movie Sleepy Hollow when he heard it was going to be put down, I know it is freezing... in Chicago it is near -24. So cold!
1364,1622,9/14/2021 21:52," hi, do you like johnny depp?"," Wow!! Its definitely a good day to stay in and catch some movies. Speaking of movies, Black Panther has the richest superhero out there, worth $500 billion!"
1217,1623,10/5/2021 9:18," Hi, how are you? Who is Johnny Depp? A singer? An athlete?", That's a lot of money. They are re-releasing th emovie for free from February 1 - 7 for african american month...
1128,1624,9/16/2021 11:05," He is an actor. He is the one that directed the movie The Brave, if you have seen it", Wow!! Thats amzinzing. I know there was a lot of confusion when the movie was first released...many people confused it with the black panther party. 
1238,1625,9/1/2021 9:48, I have not seen it. Is it about brave people or an Indian brave? Is he an American Indian?," Yeah, they are a lot different. T'challa is the richest superhero/"
691,1626,9/18/2021 17:31, I think he might be partly american indigenous. I am not sure though.," That's interesting! You know, there's a lot that we can do with this extra day off with the cold and all...we have the whole day to indulge. Did you know that when the Earth was first formed, a day was only 5.5 hours long?"
151,1627,9/5/2021 11:50, Is he pretty ethnic? I think he'd have to be pretty ethnic to pull that off. Not like Elvis. Was Johnny a friend of Nic Cage?, I had no idea. I do know that I am working on this cold day and worked out this morning. It has been a cold day!
437,1628,9/28/2021 6:21, He might be I am not sure. He even adopted the one eyed horse that was in the movie saleepy hollow," Yes it has. The weather and the earth's atmosphere is forever changing. By the 21st century, we anticipate running out of Helium. That's going to significantly impact human life...scary!!"
1089,1629,9/29/2021 20:29, A one-eyed horse? That sounds odd. What is so charming about Cyclops the Horse? I guess you would have to put an eyepatch over one of the eyes., How is it going to impact humans> I am curious to know more!
1091,1630,10/12/2021 19:45, They were going to put the horse down so he wanted to save it," Well, for one, Helium makes up a large portion of our atmosphere. I do know that. And Helium helps to keep things floating so I can only imagine the impact will be negative!"
582,1631,8/24/2021 10:54," I guess he had a place for keeping horses. Do you know much about government? I am not a fan of government. It seems like a useful invention, much like a one-eyed horse.", Thanks for the insight. I had no idea!
229,1632,9/8/2021 15:18, Me either but I do find it strange that the govnerment owns 86% of the land in Nevada," I'm just thinking about how our atmosphere works... I', no expert but I think its safe to say that the absence of Helium could come at a high cost."
821,1633,9/27/2021 17:11, I figure the gov't must be up to something in that Nevada desert. War games? Alien spaceports?, I agree. I had no idea that it was that precious.
1138,1634,10/13/2021 21:20, I have no idea they are certainly using it for something. Did you ever play nintendo?, Yessss!! I guess we could gain more insight about what the future holds for humanity by reading the bible. Did you know that the bible is the biggest selling non-fiction book ever printed? That's pretty impressive!
1166,1635,9/18/2021 2:51, I played a bit. I warn't into them games. I had other chores to attend to on the farm/prison where I growed up. You? Did you play them games?, I did. George W bush read 41 biographies of lincoln. That's crazy! I do not think Lincoln knew that much about himself.
790,1636,8/28/2021 20:59, Sounds rough. Do you know about wikileaks?, That's funny!! And probably true!! He also read 186 historical nonfiction books!! That's a lot of knowledge!
1057,1637,9/14/2021 19:46," I applied for a job there, but they didn't hire me. Said my background wasn't suspicious enough. "," Yeah, I can barely read and here he is showing off reading that much@"
1015,1638,8/29/2021 8:24, Hahhaha that is funny. did you know they figured out the government is trying to destroy them, I hear ya!! Jack London lived as a poor down and out pauper and still managed to write a book about exposing the gap between the rich and the poor. So there's always hope!! Keep at your reading... and you'll get better!
940,1639,10/12/2021 4:48," Well, they are Wikileaks, so they have a list of enemies pretty long. ", I hope! I have written a lot so I hope it all comes together!
1083,1640,9/1/2021 12:55, Yes that makes sense. Did you know a man in france sold the eiffer tower twice?," I do too!!! Well, its been good talking to you. I have to get going. Have a great day. Goodbye!"
917,1641,9/15/2021 23:21," That man could probably sell the govt's land in Nevada for us! Well, I've had a swell time chatting!", You too!
1269,1642,8/25/2021 3:34," Same here, have a good one."," Hello, what kind of genre do you prefer in books?"
315,1643,8/31/2021 16:16, Hi! Did you know the Prime Minister of Australia's position isn't actually in their constitution but only exists through custom? I find that surprising!," I prefer non fiction.  Although in fiction, I like mystery and drama.  What authors do you like?"
1278,1644,9/22/2021 19:59, Wow I didn't know that. I also didn't know that the Prime Minister selects and then can dismiss members of the cabinet. I always wondered what they did, I do not have a favorite author but I love the Harry Potter series.
379,1645,8/31/2021 19:28," It's a little strange, isn't it? But on a lighter note, a radio station prank called Queen Elizabeth II back in 95, pretending to be Jean Chretien who was the Prime Minister of Canada back then. Ha!"," I enjoyed the movie, Black Panther which was based on a Marvel Comics character."
403,1646,10/12/2021 17:23," That is very strange. Do you know who Helena Bonham Carter is? She was in the Harry Potter movies, but anyway she is the great-granddaughter of a prime minister", I love all the movies of Harry Potter too! I love Black Panther. WAKANDA FOREVER!
759,1647,9/2/2021 17:17," Is that so? I wonder if she used her family to become an actress? Ha! Well in Japan, their Prime Minister sends their residents a silver cup when they turn 100 to celebrate it. Problem is, so many are turning 100 now, they're having to find ways to make cheaper cups. That's a good thing though!", The director of Black Panther also co-wrote it.  He must have earned some bucks.
401,1648,8/23/2021 23:50," That is a good thing! What do you think about Wikileaks by the way? Apparently the government try to destroy them, but Wikileaks just leaked their plans LOL", I bet he earns a lot of money! That was a popular movie.
1333,1649,9/5/2021 8:27," That's kind of ironic, isn't it? I wonder if Wikileaks will tell us what the government does with the 86% of Nevada's land that they own?", His name is Ryan Coogler.
1249,1650,10/13/2021 5:41," That is a good question. Maybe it is Area 51 that they own haha? It's also crazy to think that Norway donated a billion dollars to help save the rainforest, I wonder if they own the land or just donated it", Ryan Coogler? It made me think of cougar
1138,1651,9/1/2021 18:31, That's a good question. I'm glad they're taking action to protect the rainforests though! Did you ever hear about the guy in France who posed as a government official and sold the Eiffel Tower twice? It's like how did he pull that off? Someone like him could sell fire in hell! Ha!, One woman got a role in the movie and began her acting career at age 88. That's old
22,1652,9/5/2021 2:09, Haha yes a very talented salesman for sure! Definitely a scam too. What do you think about the actor Johnny Depp by the way? He likes to live in France, I agree. Unless she has that energy.
492,1653,8/26/2021 18:57, Does he really? I think he's a great actor. Although I'm not sure about his directing skills as I still haven't seen The Brave that he directed back in 1997!," Marvel started a studio to do the film.  They borrowed money and put their other characters up as collateral.  If the studio had failed, Merril Lynch would have owned Captain America and others."
1485,1654,9/30/2021 11:36," No I've never even heard of that movie. I do know that gives a good actor, I loved him in Edward Scissorhands even though he only said 196 words", I started liking Marvel after Spider Verse. That is crazy.
807,1655,10/1/2021 17:30, That is weird to have so few lines like that! I can't believe Gene Wilder didn't watch the Willy Wonka remake because he didn't want to be disappointed in Depp. That is a little disappointing to me.," I grew up on DC comics, but Marvel has cut their own niche.  Denzel Washington helped Chadwick Boseman financially to study at Oxford 20 years ago.  That produced a great result."
372,1656,10/9/2021 6:21, Yes that is disappointing. I hope that Johnny Depp goes through with making a biopic about dr. Seuss. That would actually be my first choice for a person to play him, What is your favorite DC comic?
261,1657,9/20/2021 16:01," Agreed. That would be cool to see. I mean, I think that film would earn him another academy award nomination. I mean, He's already been nominated for three!", I prefer Superman but Justice League is a close second.  He can turn back time by circling the earth.  The earth is the densest of the 4 terrestrial planets.
307,1658,9/22/2021 16:38," Yes that is impressive! He seems like a nice guy, he adopted a one-eyed horse in one of his movies because they were going to put it down, that's nice thing to do", Have you watched Bumblebee? 
860,1659,10/1/2021 8:39," That's a very nice and humane thing to do! He's certainly come a long way since his rise in the 1980s with 21 Jump Street, hasn't he?", I don't know what that is.  Enlighten me.
416,1660,8/25/2021 20:59," Yes absolutely! It's crazy that he was born in 1963, I remember when he was just a young man", Have you heard of Transformers?
576,1661,8/30/2021 16:58, Absolutely! Back when he was just becoming a teen idol before going on to win Best Actor at both the Golden Globes and the Screen Actor's Guild Awards!, Of course.  They would certainly be in the genre of Sci-fi if they were in a book.
1387,1662,9/27/2021 4:23, Yes absolutely! I never knew that he was actually named John Christopher Depp II though. I wonder if his dad was also an actor?, Bumble bee is that one yellow robot. That movie is all about him.
788,1663,9/26/2021 4:20," I wonder that as well now that you mention it! Hey, maybe one day he'll run for a position in the government! Ha! I'm sure he's wise enough to know each government has a constitution in place which as you know is a statement of its philosophies and principles! Well it was great chatting with you! Have a good evening, friend!", I see.  Guess I will go now.  
259,1664,9/24/2021 7:11," How's it going, do you watch Horror films? The first ones were inspired by Edgar Allan Poe and Mary Shelley"," Good morning, are you a fan of standup comedy?"
334,1665,9/30/2021 20:21," I love horror movies, I am a stephen king fan!", good morning. I am a little bit of a fan. Are you a fan?
1000,1666,9/30/2021 16:45, It's kinda strange Stephen King considers bambi a horror movie," Yes, I've been trying to go to a lot more shows lately. I recently saw Bill Burr and he was very funny."
1313,1667,9/5/2021 21:58," Right, it must have made him so scared as a kid. I think about the shining sometimes, good movie. The boy in the movie didnt know it was a horror movie until years later", That's cool.  I like comedy movies and tv shows.  Have you ever seen 3rd rock from the sun?
364,1668,10/11/2021 20:04, I'm surprised the boy from the shinning couldn't figure out he was in a horror movie from the scenes with the bloody elevator and creepy twins, I have watched a few episodes but I didn't follow it closely? How about you?
612,1669,10/12/2021 23:08," right, or the guy breaking down the door. I wonder how the movie was at the box office"," I've seen a few. I heard it beat out Seinfeld, Friends, and even Frasier for the best comedy award in 1997."
86,1670,9/19/2021 13:18," Probably pretty scary, apparently you can burn more than 180 calories watching a horror movie"," That was a lot of great shows nominated at once. I watch a lot of Brooklyn Nine Nine now, I think that's one of the best shows on TV."
55,1671,10/4/2021 18:00, Dang I need to watch like 10 per night for my diet since I don't do anything else lol, I've never seen it but I have seen the commercials and it looks funny.  You are right about all those great shows.  Sounds like there was a lot of good comedy back in 1997.
1222,1672,8/25/2021 17:20, Watching horror movies also makes viewing abstract art more enjoyable too, It's definitely not the same these days as it was back then. I think the rise of cable prices has hurt how many people are watching TV.
564,1673,9/18/2021 20:58," I wonder how that works, do you know the science behind it?", Speaking of cable tv. What do you think of comedy central?
1424,1674,9/21/2021 18:41," I have no clue, probably something to do with psychology that makes abstract art more enjoyable after a horror movie"," I like Comedy Central, I haven't watched it as much lately because I have been watching Netflix and Amazon Prime more."
1175,1675,9/24/2021 4:55," I bet. You know what else is scary, Treasure Island by disney only made 309 dollars on a 15000000 dollar budget!", Comedy Central may be very particular on how they do comedy.  I've heard they've canceled over 100 shows since they started back in 1989.
818,1676,9/30/2021 0:50," Yea, that is pretty horrible. Treasure Planet by Disney was also a huge box office flop", That's a lot of shows to cancel. I know from watching Daniel Tosh's show he would reference a show they canceled quickly each week.
1184,1677,8/30/2021 2:52," sorry I meant treasure planet lol. Silence of the lambs came out on valentines day, imagine that date? lol", Really?  I guess they are selective then.  i've never watched the channel. Do they do different types of comedy or just one?
264,1678,9/8/2021 11:53, Well it couldn't of been that bad since Silence of the lambs made 270 million at the box office, They have a lot of original programming so they broadcast a wide variety of comedy. They also air original stand up comedy specials as well.
1155,1679,8/29/2021 12:11," for sure, I mean bringing your date to it! Almost as crazy as disney almost shutting down their studios because of sleeping beauty failing", So have you ever seen ken jeong perform?
450,1680,9/9/2021 11:51," That is crazy. Do you like Tom Hanks, he's grossed over 8.5 billion at the box office", I have not seen him perform his stand up yet. He just released a new special on Netflix. I have only seen him in movies and on TV.
564,1681,9/19/2021 17:48," Man, he should be in every movie at that much money! Youre guaranteed to make money at that rate i think"," Yeah, i haven't seen him either.  I heard he used to be a doctor of some kind."
1198,1682,9/19/2021 9:40," Yea, Tom Hanks is the highest all-time box office draw"," Yes he was, it's a pretty interesting career transition from being a doctor to being an actor."
310,1683,9/27/2021 2:56," That is amazing, great actor! good chatting with you!", Especially to a stand up comedian/actor.  I wonder what made him do it.
814,1684,9/28/2021 14:58, Have a good one," He must have really felt the calling to it. It was fun chatting about comedy with you, have a great day!"
1424,1685,8/24/2021 13:57, Good Morning! Do you like to watch horror films?, Have you ever had a seizure? I can't believe that someone had a seizure at Ken Jeong's comedy show!
383,1686,8/23/2021 21:47," Hi, how are you? I am not really a fan of the genre, though I have some favorites.", I have never had one but i have seen people have them and yeah he thought it was a heckler thats pretty insane
643,1687,9/2/2021 8:34, What are some of your favorite ones? Stephen king considers Bambi one haha., I know! Crazy! I would have probably though the same. They said he ran right over to the person! 
1012,1688,9/20/2021 13:51," King was just a kid, to be fair. That movie could be scary to a tiny child. He then turned his fright into a profession.", Yeah he was an internal medicine practitioner before he turned to comedy so he attended to the woman until medics arrived
1449,1689,10/4/2021 4:40, You're right on that one. Did you know you can burn 180 calories watching one?, That is great. I heard that the audience members didn't even record this. Amazing!
17,1690,9/15/2021 20:07," I suppose that I could try to lose weight that way. It might be easier to exercise. I like a couple of films, but after the first viewing, they are not as scary.", That is suprising considering how glued people are to their phones
1415,1691,9/27/2021 3:18, Just do a marathon one day of watching them and you'll be set. Have you seen the Shining? The boy actor didn't even know it was a horror film until years later., I agree. I just hope most people are happy with how he reacted. That can be crazy!
1427,1692,10/4/2021 21:06, I liked the Shining. King wrote a great story and it translated well to the screen. I am surprised by the kid though. What did he think it was?, I agree the audience met him with a round of applause when he returned to the stage.
1205,1693,9/15/2021 18:51, That is a good question. You would think watching the cinematography alone would let you know it was one!," So, Did you even realize that Comedy Central has cancelled over 100 shows since 1989??"
1243,1694,9/18/2021 2:20, I wonder if he ever saw the film while he was a kid. I think maybe his parents wouldn't let him. , no I did not realize that why are they cancelling so many shows? 
944,1695,9/3/2021 14:56, That could be it! Did you know no woman has ever been nominated for best cinematography at the oscars?, Personally it feels like it because so many people are so sensitive now. 
858,1696,9/19/2021 15:38," That is a shame. I don't know how many women cinematographers there are, but probably not enough. There should be more.", I agree with that I think people are way too sensitive now.. I liked all the shows that used to be on like 3rd Rock form the Sun it won the golden globe for best comedy series in 1997
1133,1697,10/9/2021 23:03, I agree with you! Especially with the box office at what it is. I would hate to work for the movie Trojan Wars. They made only 309 dollars on a budget of 15 million!, I loved 3rd rock!  Are you into comics at all? I am not but my boys are.
738,1698,9/7/2021 9:55," Movies are such a crapshoot. There is no magic formula for success. Stars, special FX, marketing. Doesn't matter.", I am a huge super hero nerd lol... I love the avengers marvel or dc comics idc I like it all lol
1247,1699,9/18/2021 12:56," They really are, even with the big names. Tom Hanks has earned 8.5 billion in film earnings for his movies.", I don't know know that much about it. Have you heard about the generic comic book?
701,1700,8/28/2021 5:20, He is a bankable star. People love him. But he also works with certain people regularly. Spielberg. Zemeckis. They are capable directors., Yeah Marvel published it in order to trademark the names of the heroes and villians
300,1701,8/29/2021 8:46, Oh for sure! Have you seen Disney's Treasure Planet? That was one of the most expensive box office flops ever., I had no idea what dc comics stands for? 
65,1702,9/6/2021 5:49, I did not. Was that animated? Usually animated stuff is pretty good. I'm surprised., the dc stands for detective comics
974,1703,9/21/2021 16:35," I am surprised too, especially with the Disney name attached to it!", Oh! I get that. Did you know that the Michigan State U library has the largest publicly available comic book collection!? 
1433,1704,8/31/2021 2:34, I guess a lot depends on the director. I don't know who directed Treasure Planet., I did not know that... I know that there are some that sell for a pretty penny
1117,1705,9/4/2021 13:17, I am going to google that now. Have a good day!, So good talking to you tonight!!
122,1706,9/24/2021 13:46, Are you a soccer or tennis fan?, Hi! Do you watch any comedy?
1464,1707,9/30/2021 4:42," Well I personally prefer tennis, but I also like lacrosse, did you hear about the spring all met boys lacrosse team?", Sometimes. What about you?
290,1708,10/12/2021 11:52," No, what was that?"," Yeah, though I have never seen any one perform live. Ken Jeong, the comedian is actually a licensed physician and even saved someone who had a seizure during his shows!"
801,1709,9/11/2021 5:50," Well they want a lot of Awards this year, and I think they're going to do even better next year", Oh wow he is a real doctor? I thought that was just a bit for tv. 
767,1710,8/23/2021 3:40, I will have to follow them. Tennis is fun too. a black man won the us open in 1968 and no other black man has since then. That would be award worthy," He actually went to medical school and did residency to become licensed, but I'm guessing he makes way more as a famous comedian than as a physician, what do you think?"
688,1711,8/29/2021 8:09," Yes they should make a movie about him! it's interesting to that until 1978 you could use any object as a tennis racket, that sounds dangerous", That is crazy to think we live in a society where being famous can pay more than people whos job it is to save lives. 
783,1712,9/25/2021 19:52, That would be hilarious to see what some  people came up with. What would  you use? lol," Yeah, like I remember reading that the actor who plays Dr. House gets paid more than $700K per episode! I'm thinking doctor's make about that in a year or something."
233,1713,9/25/2021 17:38, I would use a rocket launcher LOL just kidding. do you watch soccer at all? Apparently soccer makes more than all other sports combined, Wow that is just crazy amounts of money. But look at the budget for movies like avengers. Billions of dollars. 
443,1714,10/11/2021 3:42," Lol that would be perfect, no opponent means you  win everytime! "," Considering that Infinity War was the first film to ever be shot entirely with digital imax cameras, they probably needed that billion dollars."
495,1715,9/7/2021 1:44," That's a great point! Did you know that table tennis is the name of the actual sport, and that ping pong is only the name of the company that sells the table tennis equipment?", Probably. Have to admit it though it made for one heck of a movie. 
925,1716,9/14/2021 18:37," I did not know that, wow! Mind blown! Back to soccer, did you have a favorite team in the world cup?"," Yeah! Was it because of the script or the all-star cast which included Robert Downey, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans, Benedict Cumberbatch, Christ Pratt?"
10,1717,8/31/2021 20:43, No I don't. I really don't like soccer I think it's boring LOL it's weird to me that the Super Bowl is smaller than soccer's biggest events, I think the script. They have taken actors that were only sort of known and really put them on the map with these amazing scripts. 
97,1718,9/21/2021 2:56," it is boring, but it is kind of fun to watch one week per 4 years lol. I liked Brazil"," Yeah, I agree but what I'm wondering is what the movie has to do with increase in shawarma sales, do you have any idea, did I miss something from the movie?"
331,1719,10/4/2021 3:18," Well soccer is a good exercise though, apparently a player will run about 7 miles per game, that's good for burning calories", It has caused that? That is awesome! There is a scene at the end of the battle in new york where they all go for shawarma and are chilling around this table. It is iconic in the avengers universe. 
150,1720,9/25/2021 20:07," so good, they always have tight bodies lol. There was a german soccer player who donated 300000 euros to help pay for surgeries in brazil"," Oh! I really did miss it, thanks for clarifying! Crazy to think how the voice actor who plays Jarvis has never seen any of the films! Wouldn't he be invited to the screening and stuff?"
1021,1721,10/2/2021 21:31," That's really nice of him! What a nice guy, why do you think Greenland can't join FIFA? Apparently it's because they can't grow green grass LOL", You would think. Isn't he the guy that plays vision now?
22,1722,9/20/2021 17:59," lol, that is a valid point but don't you think they could use turf? That is a little wrong i think "," Oh really? I don't know, I'd have to read up on the books to know. Did you have read the comic books before watching the movies?"
1443,1723,9/25/2021 4:52," Yep I agree it seems stupid. I don't know why they need to play on grass specifically, did you hear about the longest tennis point of all time?", No I've never been much of a comic book reader. It sounds like there are some interesting storylines that could be turned into movies though. 
711,1724,10/13/2021 22:43, I didn't what was that?," Yeah, me neither but it sure opens your mind to endless creativity like the universe takes place in earth 199999 years ago and there's a multiverse too!"
1265,1725,8/23/2021 17:40," I was asking about the longest point in pro tennis, apparently it lasted for 29 minute straight, it was a 600 shot rally, that's incredible", Stan lee was a visionary. He will be so missed. I can't imagine not seeing his cameos in the coming movies. 
563,1726,8/29/2021 15:35," Wow, great chatting with you!"," Yeah exactly and who's going to end phone conversations with ""excelsior"" like he did."
1125,1727,9/30/2021 20:46, Hello," Hello, are you a comedy fan?  Are you familiar with Ken Jeong's"
1010,1728,8/25/2021 6:44, Hi. Do you play tennis?, Not really but I have heard of the show The Hangover. Some comics are really brutal and I don't like humor that hurts people.
300,1729,10/2/2021 7:27," I used to and love it.  Polo shirts were originally invented for tennis by famous player rene ""the crocodile"" lacoste and only later adopted by polo players", He is actually a Dr.  He studied at Duke University.
210,1730,10/11/2021 21:20, I once watched a match where single point lasted nearly 30 minutes. It was historic, That is interesting. I wonder why he went from medicine to humor? It's a good thing because he saved the woman in the story.
1249,1731,8/27/2021 23:37," Wow, They used a helicopter to dry the grass tennis courts for the 1969 us open"," Yes, I heard about this awhile back.  A women was having a seizure.  He first thought she was a heckler."
716,1732,9/12/2021 13:27, I remember when players could use just about everything for a racket except the kitchen sink," Hecklers are not funny at all. I went to a comedy show where there were several and they ruined the whole performance. I don't think I could be a comedian you have to have a tough skin. He is good, though."
1063,1733,9/21/2021 9:44," Haha, The longest match in tennis history went on for 11 hours and was spread over 3 days."," It is said that once he realized what was going on, he jumped off stage and into action."
586,1734,9/14/2021 23:25, Do you know who played in that match?, I suspect that the training never leaves you. I would rather be a doctor but I guess he does really well acting. Comedy is a lot of fun if you don't hurt other people with jokes.
1326,1735,9/23/2021 1:11," No, I sure don't.  I bet they were worn out though.", I'm sure he makes more as a comedian and actor.  After his actions he told the crowd that he checked her vitals and reassured the crowd.  They applaued him.
1340,1736,10/6/2021 8:33, Tennis players make quite a bit of money if they win a tournament but not as much as soccer players," I like The Three Stooges type of humor. Or Mr. Bean. I just watched one of his movies and I laughed all the way through. He makes fun of himself, mostly. And it hurts no one. "
762,1737,9/2/2021 21:45," Yes, they do.  On another note, did you know that the rapper drake graduated high school on october 2012 at the age of 25", Ken got his break in a comedy contest.  He then moved to LA and performed sets after long days in a HMO clinic.
696,1738,10/2/2021 11:06, That is a little late isn't it or do Canadians graduate at a later age?, That must have been difficult so he must have a real gift for comedy. I will have to check it out.'The empire strikes back'  was a comedy and I did not even know that. I need to keep up these movies.
811,1739,9/30/2021 7:56," Haha, that is very late.  Probably a ssllooww learner.  The beat of drake's song ""hotline bling"" is actually sampled from timmy thomas' 1972 hit ""why we can't live together""."," YOU SHOULD DO THAT.  DID YOU KNOW THAT BILL MURRAY THINKS ""KUNG FU HUSTLE"" IS THE SUPREME ACHIVEMENT IN COMEDY?"
1290,1740,10/2/2021 4:55, I absolutely love his music!," I don't know Kung Foo Hustle. Bill Murray is funny, though. I remember him on Saturday Night Live. Now that was funny. Especially Gilda Radner and Chevy Chase."
786,1741,8/23/2021 14:11," During a uk tour in 2011, drake spent an Obscene amount of money'' on first editions of children's classic books  Charlotte's web' and  Winnie the pooh'.", Bill Murray is an all time great.  I also saw that the Green Lantern movie was originally going to be a comedy with Jack Black.
51,1742,9/26/2021 19:02, I wonder why he would do that. He doesn't seem like he is into reading seeing as though he graduated high school so late, The Greeks invented comedy as part of a dramatic performance. I would like to go back and see how funny they were compared to today's comedians.
765,1743,9/25/2021 23:45," Good question.  After hearing eminem's verse on drake's song forever, kanye west took two days and cancelled appointments to rewrite his."," I didn't know that.  Speaking of comedy and movies, The Avengers movie ""Infinity War"" was the first movie shot completely with digital imax cameras "
1403,1744,8/24/2021 19:23, Didn't Drake do some acting when he was younger?," That's another one I haven't seen. That's is interesting, though. I like the raven's names Hugin and Munin."
1486,1745,9/3/2021 5:34, Yes.  Drake initially gained recognition as an actor on the teen drama television series Degrassi: The Next Generation in the early 2000s.," I am a huge comic book fan.  Lou Ferrifno, who played the Hulk in the original 1670's tv show has voiced him dor everything up until Avengers Age of Ultron"
253,1746,10/13/2021 1:22," They named a college after him too, didn't they?", There were a lot of big starts doing the voices in the Avengers.  I like the Hulk. I always felt sorry for his character.
1462,1747,8/23/2021 16:32, I'm not sure about that.," Yes, he is kind of sad.  Well have a Merry Christmas."
1172,1748,9/17/2021 5:03, I'm gonna go listen to his album on YouTube now. , Good Morning! Have you ever heard of K-Pop?
1497,1749,9/4/2021 20:06," Hello,  how are you doing? Soccer makes more money than football, basketball, baseball, golf, tennis and hockey combined."," K-pop is the music which is originated in South Korea, they are more popular in 2000."
76,1750,9/6/2021 18:08," Hello, I'm doing great. Have you ever watched the variation that has three teams, instead of two?", I like how South Korea blasted K-Pop across the border to North Korea in 2010.
338,1751,10/7/2021 11:18, Nope.  Did you know Jon stewart was a skilled soccer player in college and represented the us at the pan american maccabi games in brazil in 1983.," The north korea sank a south korean warship in 2010, south korea responded by blasting the k-pop song ""hit your heart"" across the border using large military loud speakers."
675,1752,9/3/2021 21:51," I do not follow soccer, I do remember reading about the German player who donated his bonus so 23 kids could have surgery.", I bet that was very annoying to listen to all day and night! Did you know even Jackie Chan manages a K-Pop boy band?
516,1753,8/30/2021 8:18," Wow so generous!  thats amazing! Americans call it ""soccer"" because it was slang for association football"," Dance can be categorized and described by its choreography, to make the movement repeat and well organised."
1381,1754,10/3/2021 0:48, I find it fascinating that they used to dry the tennis couts for the 69' US Open with helicopters. I would have loved to see that.," Speaking of choreography, ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of shows a week!"
1492,1755,9/12/2021 7:30, Seems like a huge expense lol, Ballet dance is originated in Italian Renaissance in the 15th century and it become concert dance in France and Russia.
788,1756,10/1/2021 18:52," I didn't know the rapper Drake, was Canadian, did you?"," I think it is cool that it's still around to this day. Michael Jackson has some patents on some of his dance moves, crazy!"
1451,1757,9/11/2021 14:37," Yes. During a uk tour in 2011, drake spent an ""obscene amount of money'' on first editions of children's classic books 'charlotte's web' and 'winnie the pooh'.", Dance is also represent the culture and traditional of particular region. Mostly it make our body well control and organised.
702,1758,10/6/2021 22:49," That's sweet, and it's interesting that he chose to graduate at 25, instead of getting his GED.", Even Tupac dance ballet in high school and performed in the production of the nutcracker.
1141,1759,9/21/2021 1:24," Yeah,  maybe he really liked his friends that were still in the high school. ", Babies are dances immediately when they hear music and make their body very flexible.
1465,1760,9/6/2021 11:36," Kanye is so sensitive, I cannot believe that he actually cancelled appointments to rewrite his part of a song with Drake, after hearing Eminiem's verse.", I think it's crazy how babies can do that. I can't believe Bruce Lee was a dancer and was even in a dance championship in 1958!
340,1761,9/28/2021 12:44," Yeah,  he definitely is sensitive. "," It is very interesting. Dance is art, sometime other forms of human movement are sometimes said to have dance like quality, including martial arts and physical activity."
1209,1762,8/30/2021 4:01," Did you watch the show Degrassi? He was an actor on it, I've never heard of it."," That is an awesome type of art! I think birds are a type of art as well, especially hummingbirds that steal spider webs for their own nests."
1499,1763,9/2/2021 8:02, I've heard of it never watched it though.  Is that Disney?, Birds are living world wide and there are more than ten thousand spices world wide. Birds have wings which developed more or less according to their species.
972,1764,8/24/2021 2:17," I'm not sure, as I've never watched it, even though it was on for seven years."," That is a lot of species! In most birds, their skeleton weighs less than their feathers!"
919,1765,9/15/2021 12:30, The rapper drake visited drake university in the middle of the night after students gave up trying to get him to visit during a tour stop., So only it make to fly very high and far away. Some times birds travel from one continent to another continent for their breed.
701,1766,10/11/2021 16:05," That's funny, I bet he made their night. I was surprised to hear that he is signed with Lil' Wayne's label, instead of Dre's Death Row.", They even go without sleeping during the migration!
1130,1767,9/6/2021 23:18," Yes,  that was very interesting,  although either way he still would've made a lot of money", Yeah. They no need of visa and other formalities.
327,1768,10/4/2021 9:28," I think One Dance is my favorite by him, it's also one of his most popular.", They really don't huh? Have a good day!
176,1769,9/19/2021 6:22," me too,  that song was great!  good talking to you "," Hi, how are you?"
184,1770,10/1/2021 23:54," Hi, do you know anything about lacrosse?", Good. I learned a few fun facts. Did you know that Bruce Lee was a great dancer as well as kung fu star and won the Hong Kong Cha-Cha championship in 1958.
551,1771,9/30/2021 4:24," Hello there, I don't know too much I will say, how about you"," That's cool,never would have pictured him doing the Cha Cha but it takes the same skills probably to perform Kung Fu."
842,1772,9/18/2021 16:48, Not a ton... I love sports though so I could get into it if I needed to. Do you like any other sports?," Other stars you would not expect, Tupac danced ballet and was the Mouse King in his high school production of the Nutcracker."
1349,1773,8/24/2021 7:58," Yeah same here, I like to be able to at least play every sport just a bit once. Do you follow tennis at all?"," Wow, Tupac?  You must be pulling my leg!  Never could he be a ballet dancer.  Wow!"
1398,1774,10/7/2021 11:35, I do. I used to play a lot but not any more. Do you play too?, I know but creative people are drawn to the arts. Just like how babies are drawn to music. They will spontaneously dance when they hear music and smile when they hit the beat.
149,1775,8/31/2021 8:20," I have tried to play a few times, but that game is pretty tough.  Did you know you could use any object as a racket until 1978?  Wonder if anyone ever used anything strange. "," Speaking of ballet, did you know that ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week?"
1124,1776,9/25/2021 2:26, Probably but not in serious competitions. A tennis player actually invented the polo! Who knew!, That is a lot of shoes. They must need it for all the extreme moves they perform. Kind of like Michael Jackson's extreme lean that he has a patent on.
672,1777,9/14/2021 23:52," Lol, that is pretty funny, and now they have the polo players on there, I bet the company wants people to think they invented them. ", You're probably right!
870,1778,8/30/2021 22:12," The player was Rene ""The crocodile"" lacoste. His company uses the alligator and is called Lacoste still!", Some birds are so beautiful it is almost like they are dancing in flight. Hummingbirds are some of my favorites. Did you know they steal spiderwebs to build their nests?
678,1779,10/5/2021 20:19," That is awesome, yeah I still see the alligator shirts around a bit these days.  What a cool name!"," Yes, birds are amazing.  Their bones are so hollow the fearthers weigh more than their skeletons."
980,1780,8/23/2021 11:09, They use helicopters to dry us open tennis courts. Who knew!, That is fascinating. Some birds migrate from Alaska to Mexico without sleeping!
691,1781,9/24/2021 18:16, I heard about that!  During a major tournament or something right?," I wouldn't make a good bird!  Couldn't do that, at all."
758,1782,10/11/2021 17:02," Yeah, the US open. Seems like they should have been more prepared.", Me either. I sometimes worry I would be like a dodo bird. They are in a sub-family of pigeon.
143,1783,8/24/2021 7:26," Yeah, but, to me that is pretty good improvisation for whoever came with that idea. "," Lol, didn't know that!  I read some wild Australian birds can mimic sounds like chainsaws and car alarms!"
389,1784,9/5/2021 16:21, Agreed. I work in recreation facilities and would not have thought of calling in a helicopter for any of my isssues., I find birds fascinating. They evolved wings and yet some lost the ability to fly like penguins. And then there are others that lived near water that became great at swimming.
99,1785,9/1/2021 23:42, Right same here (if i did work in that area).  Do you know what the longest rally was in tennis history?," If I was a bird, I hope I would have enough smarts to evolve to thrive in my environment.  Our poor birds today are struggling.  I've watched Canadian Geese all winter try to figure out when to head back North, only to hit a blizzard and have to turn around and fly back South.  It's sad."
279,1786,8/24/2021 10:55, I have no idea. How long?, It is sad. They are such a great indicator species of our environment. Everything from the smallest 2 inch hummingbird to the 9 foot ostrich.
968,1787,10/13/2021 8:20," It was a 643 shot rally that went on for almost 30 minutes!  That is insane, those people must have been tired after that one lol. "," On a different note, have you ever heard of K pop?"
1412,1788,8/31/2021 23:04, I know. The longest match in history was 11 hours over 3 days! , I have and I was shocked to find out that Jackie Chan manages a k-pop boy band.
524,1789,10/6/2021 12:35," Holy cow, I wonder how many people that started watching that match actually finished?"," Wow, didn't know that about Jackie. Well, it's been nice chatting this morning.  Have a good Friday."
148,1790,10/5/2021 17:27," I would have fallen asleep, all three days! Nice chatting with you!", Do you like dogs?
207,1791,9/28/2021 12:59, Hello there. Have you ever played the guitar or piano?," I do, Im a dog person, what about you?"
244,1792,9/8/2021 7:11, no. I would have liked to play but never did. Fan of guitar players from the 60s and 70s, I like them though I don't have one. Dogs and elephants are the only animals that can naturally understand pointing.
490,1793,10/2/2021 1:02," oh nice! That reminds me, Eddie van Halen actually set a studio speaker on fire from playing the guitar solo for Beat It, ", They are? I guess both are really smart dogs can also see color so thats something. 
1325,1794,9/19/2021 2:55, I have heard that. Hendrix set his guitar on fire at Woodstock.," Interesting. Always thought they were color blind. Google also prefers dogs to cats, so much that it is in their code of conduct."
403,1795,9/16/2021 3:52," That just shows how badass they are, haha! The best guitarists are the ones that set stuff on fire from playing... or have a phd in astrophysics like the one from Queen."," And that's why I love Google, that and also the fact that Google has saved my life many times lol"
248,1796,9/23/2021 13:36, Yes. He is a smart guy., I feel bad for stray dogs sometimes. Istanbul has a vending machine that releases food and water for them if you recycle plastic bottles.
341,1797,8/29/2021 3:10, Do you know how to play the guitar? , I guess those vending machines make a lot of doggies happy and also they help keep the streets clean. Its a win win situation I guess
1001,1798,9/4/2021 10:24, No. I wish that I did, yeah I think you're right. Another good cause is doggy blood drives. However not sure how the dogs feel about that since they can't consent. Haha.
1403,1799,9/21/2021 5:03," Same here. Whenever i watch people, it looks so easy to pick up and learn... until you actually try to learn and realize its alot harder than it looks hah. Taking the time to build up muscles in your fingers is hard work."," There are 12 different types of bloods in dogs, how interesting is that"
1364,1800,8/27/2021 20:44, Its a great musical instrument, Interesting! What kind of dogs do you like?
1126,1801,9/8/2021 10:13, This is true. That statement also goes well with piano's. There's so many talented artists out there that can play the piano and guitar. Did you know that Freddie Mercury used the same piano to record Bohemian rhapsody as paul mccartney used to record hey jude? That must be a super lucky piano.," I like small dogs, big dogs are high maintenance and scare others, what about you?"
1429,1802,9/2/2021 2:45, Yes. That piano must be worth a bit of money," Yeah I love a little dog, especially one in a little sweater or a shirt! I've even seen one in a polo shirt. The polo shirt was actually invented for tennis, not polo!"
669,1803,9/23/2021 13:44, I could only imagine. I wonder where they keep that piano. ," Really always thought it was a polo things, shirts are part of our culture and I guess polo shirts are a classic now"
376,1804,9/2/2021 0:46, it should be in the rock and roll hall of fame," Yeah, they were invented for tennis player Rene ""the crocodile"" Lacoste. Another shirt I like is the Hawaiian shirt. Have yet to see one on a dog. That's the official business attire in Hawaii."
1203,1805,9/21/2021 4:23, As it should be. It would be so awesome to see it in person. ," Oh so Lacoste was the inventor, thats really interesting, did you hear about Bill Mays funeral?"
359,1806,10/8/2021 23:09, A long time ago at the fillmore east I saw grand funk railroad. Talk about loud and sparks flying," No, I haven't hear about it."
648,1807,10/9/2021 2:46, Oh nice! I haven't heard of that band until now. What is some popular songs that they have? I want to look them up and give them a listen., Apparently the pallbearers wore Blue shirts in his funeral and also khaki pants. 
913,1808,9/4/2021 2:42," Were an American band, Im your Captain, Some kind of wonderful, are some hits they had in the 1970s"," That is kind of cool. Speaking of cool, do you think Ugg boots are cool? They were invented by surfers to keep their feet warm after getting out of the water."
967,1809,9/26/2021 16:25," Cool! I'm listening to Were an American band right now, i reeeeaally love the guitar playing!", I do wear them specially in the winter or when it rains I like to wear sport shoes better but boots can be comfy. 
444,1810,8/24/2021 7:52, Mark Farner i think was lead guitar," Yeah, I like them too. I have cozy sweater looking ones for the house. It's getting hot where I am already but we were blessed with another cool day. I'm going to go enjoy the evening, have a good one!"
1087,1811,9/1/2021 4:41, Nice! Well thank you for opening up my ears to some new awesome music. Now i got some new stuff to listen to. It's been a pleasure chatting with you about guitars and piano's. :)," Hello there, are you a dog or a cat person?"
256,1812,9/27/2021 23:07, The Hypocrites put on really amusing stage productions!, I would have to say I am a cat person
440,1813,9/10/2021 16:21," Yes, I would love to go and check Pirates, Pinafore and the Mikado"," I think I am a dog person, but I don't mind cats.  Did you know dogs have 12 different blood types?"
315,1814,9/22/2021 10:53, i heard that the group does them as a pajama party!, That is cool.  I heard they also have doggie blood drives too.
1243,1815,8/23/2021 4:52, That is a living dream. A pajama party and a live satirical operetta with talented musician clowns. that is something else, Yeah that is super cool!  Did you also know that dogs are not color blind like most people think?
536,1816,8/24/2021 21:10, The use of a pillow pit might be a little bit disturbing for some!," Yeah, I heard that they can see colors, not as well as we do but still in color"
462,1817,8/23/2021 5:37, It might. And it is nice they start with sweet dreams from Eurythmics," They also, along with elephants, are the only two animals the seem to understand pointing by instincts. "
1045,1818,10/2/2021 23:48, live players doing popular music like Dream On as part of the show is surprising!, They are definitely mart animals.  That might by Google prefers them to cats.
970,1819,9/8/2021 21:32," They play with music and even with toys. They did release beach balls in pirates of penzance, fun"," That is so weird, and I guess they came out and declared they were a dog company. "
1499,1820,9/3/2021 22:15, They also swap genders in the production of Pinafore.," Yeah.  I dont know why, but that is how they identify."
45,1821,8/30/2021 14:05," the price is not expensive, $30 to $74"," Did you know that in Istanbul, they have a vending machine for stray dogs?"
1291,1822,9/7/2021 20:12," Not unexpected, given that the theater only holds 100 or so people.", Yes!  It is such a cool concepts.  Recycle bottles for  dog food.  How neat!
1098,1823,10/5/2021 3:41, How much do you like jazz," Yeah I think that is really cool, and I know other countries around the world have big stray dog problems. "
112,1824,9/18/2021 8:58," I dig it.    Jazz is a music genre that originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans, United States", I think even one place in Russia dogs are trained on using the subway.
600,1825,9/2/2021 14:27," It  is fascinating, comes from ragtime and blues and it is called the Classical music of America", That is incredible.  Did you know the dog was the first species to be domesticated?
142,1826,9/27/2021 18:26," Cool jazz developed near the end of the 1940s, and is more modern."," Wow, I didn't know that.  I would have thought it was cats."
334,1827,9/29/2021 16:56, It did spread around the world and gave origin to different styles around the world, Yeah I thought the same thing!
464,1828,10/11/2021 5:40," It has spread so there is now a programming language in which the programs are written in musical composition, and functional programs have jazz-like harmonies.", I wonder why dogs seem to chew on shoes so much.
1443,1829,9/7/2021 13:27, Great! I also love the dance-oriented swing big bands like the Kansas city jazz," Same here, I know I have had plenty of shoes torn up in my lifetime by dogs!"
1036,1830,10/13/2021 14:37," Many people, even Clint eastwood are lifelong jazz enthusiasts, and scored several films, including million dollar baby", Did you know boots are a type of footwear and not a specific shoe?
122,1831,10/5/2021 22:59," Cool, it is funny that rapper Tupac Shakur studied jazz, acting and poetry.. but became a rapper."," No, I didn't know that.  It was nice talking to you today, I hope you have a day!"
814,1832,10/11/2021 16:57, People are often multitalented!    Thanks for the chat!, Hello! Do you own any dogs?
1235,1833,9/19/2021 19:55, Did you know that Jazz music originated in New Orleans?, I do!  I have one and have had one all my life since I was a kid.
340,1834,8/25/2021 1:31, Hello - I did not know that. Do you like jazz music?, Oh nice! Me too! Google even prefers dogs to cats lol.
877,1835,9/16/2021 18:06," It began in the early 1900's there and became really popular in the 1920's. I like all styles of music actually.  Rock music, pop music, country, I like it all. ", Nice!  Some dogs in Moscow have learned to use the subway!
698,1836,10/1/2021 16:06, That's pretty cool. Jazz trumpeters grew goatees to provide comfort while playing.," Well those dogs are definitely smarter than me lol. Dogs aren't color blind either, just don't see the same thing we see!"
1027,1837,10/2/2021 18:17, That's interesting to know!  There's different styles of jazz...Gypsy jazz and Kansas City jazz., I wonder why they always have said they are? lol  I always find it amusing how a dog drinks with the underside of their tongue.
233,1838,8/24/2021 17:58, I didn't know they had those two different styles. That's really cool., That is so cool. Dogs are so smart for sure! Dogs and elephants are the only animals that understand pointing.
51,1839,9/21/2021 1:49, Yes.  Clint Eastwood is a lifelong jazz fan!, Cool!  Russia has a tomb of the unknown dog as a memorial for canine research subjects.  Kind of sad.
771,1840,10/6/2021 1:13, That's cool. A Harlem woman has held free jazz concerts in her apartment for 20 years now., It really is. I just love dogs haha. Did you know in Hawaii the office attire of choice is the aloha shirt? Talk about comfy!
248,1841,10/2/2021 3:14, Neat!  I bet that is a pain to drag up the guitars and piano  up there., Nice!  Sign me up!  lol  At Billy Mays funeral the pallbearers wore blue shorts and khaki pants.  Kind of casual and different.
54,1842,8/28/2021 18:42, I bet so too. Pakistan has a jazz orchestra., RIP Billy Mays! I like how polo shirts were originally invited for tennis players.
401,1843,10/11/2021 6:06, Interesting.  I don't think of jazz when I think of Pakistan. , I didn't know that!  I know the tshirt was invented in 1904 and was marketed to bachelors who couldn't sew or replace buttons.
1002,1844,8/29/2021 19:46," Me either lol. Eddie Van Halen set his studio speakers on fire when he recorded the guitar solo for ""beat it"".", That would be the market I would have been in back then haha. I wish I would have invented the Ugg boots back then too haha.
97,1845,8/23/2021 11:31, Whoa!  His playing was literally on fire.  lol  Brian May from Queen uses coins as guitar picks.," Yes!  When we're they created?""  I think they have been around since the 1800's?"
1174,1846,9/30/2021 23:12, That's cool I've heard of people using coins before., They were actually invented by surfers to keep their feet warm on the beach after surfing!
1470,1847,9/26/2021 9:07, It probably would give it a different sound I would think since you're strumming the strings with a metal and not plastic pick., Nice.  I'm thinking of a different boot then.  lol  The late musician Prince was a fantastic bowler and wore knee high furry boots while doing it.
1113,1848,9/13/2021 6:13, I bet you're right on that. He also has a PHD in astrophysics., That would have been a sight to see! The first person ever to be photographed was actually getting his boots cleaned.
1087,1849,9/27/2021 16:24, Interesting.  The guitarist from Pink Floyd turned a houseboat into a recording studio.  Crazy stuff.," I think I've read about that before and have seen the picture.  I think it was in Paris, France."
1041,1850,10/3/2021 17:59, That's funny. A group climb Britain's highest mountain back in 2006 and found a piano on top.," It was, and took place in 1838."
72,1851,9/5/2021 10:06, I couldn't even imagine the ordeal it would have been for whomever had to take that piano up there originally.  An aluminum grand piano weighs 356 pounds and that's light compared to a regular piano., You should google it.  It's pretty neat.  They are really tiny and didn't know they were in the picture.
559,1852,9/27/2021 3:46, Wow that's much lighter compared to a regular one., Will do! Have a good one!
557,1853,10/9/2021 18:12, Freddie Mercury used the same piano to record Bohemian Rhapsody that Paul McCartney used to record Hey Jude., Hi do you like to wear shirts?  I do!  I wear them every day.
1243,1854,9/3/2021 1:53, Good talking to you!, I do.  I would be comfortable in Hawaii where the aloha shirt is official business attire.
212,1855,9/21/2021 22:58, Do you like the piano?, Wouldn't that be awesome to go to work like that!  At Billy Mays funeral the pallbearers all wore blue shirts and khaki pants.
68,1856,9/14/2021 6:00," Yes, I like the piano. I don't know how to play it, but I think that it works well in many kinds of music."," Yeah, the ""shirt"" covers such a broad variety of garments that cover the upper body.  A shirt can also be worn as a necktie."
55,1857,8/30/2021 16:51," There is an aluminum grand piano that weight 356 pounds, Im guessing thats pretty light for a piano like that one", True.  I've used them over my head to keep the sun off me. lol
208,1858,10/4/2021 20:12, True. That was the one on the Hindenburg. Probably sounded pretty tinny. Aluminum. Hm., Is it proper to wear shirts and boots that match?
270,1859,9/15/2021 20:36," Probably yeah, theres another cool fact about a piano, a group of climbers find one in the strangest of places", I would guess so? lol  Do you own a pair of Ugg boots?
809,1860,9/8/2021 17:13, I wonder why someone put a piano up there. Did they play it? Did they want others to play it? How did they put it there?, I use to back when I was stationed in California and took up surfing.  They were actually invented by surfers to keep their feet warm after getting out of the ocean.
467,1861,9/26/2021 6:00," I have no idea how it got there, that is a big mystery can you imagine reaching the top and theres a piano right there", Nice.  I was going to ask if you lived by the ocean. I've never had any even though I live by Lake Michigan.  The Nokia company originally started making rubber boots in the 1800's and they still make them to this day.
1325,1862,9/28/2021 12:04," A mystery, like the  mysterious mute man  found wandering the streets in England in 2005 and could only communicate via piano", I use to live near Lake Michigan.  I have been to both oceans and the Gulf of Mexico. I don't know if my Ugg boots would go well with my Hawaiian shirt.  What do you think? 
1406,1863,9/13/2021 21:44," I didnt hear about that mute man, sounds like an interesting anecdote"," That's awesome you've been able to see all those places.  The way I see it if you have the chance to where you can wear both at the same time, then go for it.  Life is about have fun right? lol"
345,1864,9/3/2021 16:56," Almost as strange as Richard Nixon's piano concerto, which he wrote and performed it live on the Tonight Show", I suppose.  Talking about having fun.  Did you know that farmers use to put custom boots on their turkeys.  That's just weird! lol
231,1865,8/26/2021 8:20, He did? I dint know he played the piano what other instruments do you like maybe the guitar?, lol That's funny.  I wonder if they did it so they wouldn't get clawed?  My friend had chickens growing up and they had a rooster that was super mean and would go out of it's way to try to claw you.
1285,1866,8/25/2021 12:56," The guitar is totally rad man. I dig it. Since its debut in 1949, the Les Paul Gibson es-175 guitar has never gone out of production.", Need to see if that rooster could take out a dog!  Some roosters have pretty long spikes on their feet.
730,1867,9/11/2021 8:29," I like Eddie Van Halen I heard the studio got on fire with one of his solos, so much power in that guitar"," Oh yeah.  That sucker was mean let me tell you.  I think I would have a rabid dog chase me, which by the way dogs are not color blind!"
1303,1868,9/3/2021 10:23, He really can shred. Setting the amp on fire! Great! Brian May of Queen built his guitar out of parts from an old fireplace and his mother's knitting needle. ," We could call the bout a "" Cock-a-Poodle-Do"".  That was bad! lol.  I know dogs aren't color blind but they don't see as many colors as humans do."
345,1869,10/2/2021 19:25," How the level of skill and the determination to become a guitarist, he also has a PHD in astrophysics, really intelligent man", LOL That's funny!  Google prefers dogs over cats!  The wrote in their code of conduct that they are a dog company.  It's been fun chatting with you!
1111,1870,9/19/2021 5:07," True. Cornell university researchers built the world's smallest guitar,played by a laser, about the size of a red blood cell. I bet Brian May could figure out a way to play that guitar."," Yeah, google is weird that way.  I am a cat person.  Nice talking with you.  Have a nice day!"
907,1871,9/6/2021 6:51, I bet he can he can put that PHD in astrophysics and his mad skills as a guitarist to work I think his one of the greatest of all time, Dogs and elephants are the only animals that instinctively understand pointing.  You have a nice day too!  Thanks for the chat!
1436,1872,9/20/2021 17:47, The bio-pic of Freddie Mercury did well at the Oscars. Rami Malek won Best Actor. I guess Queen is finally getting recognized by Hollywood., I read that somewhere once.  lol
950,1873,9/22/2021 20:59," He won the Oscar right, I thought he nailed it, he was great on that movie, that movie made me cry", Cool!  Have a good day!
399,1874,9/29/2021 13:07," Great guitar and piano playing too. Anyway, thanks for the chat!"," Hello, did you know the dodo bird is actual a sub-family of the pigeon."
1377,1875,10/4/2021 3:48," I agree and also great songs in the movie, the actor that plays Brian May also looks really alike"," I didn't know that- of course I believe the bird is extinct, isn't it?  This year we recently had a bunch of hummingbirds..that was a first for me and so exciting. SO TINY.."
917,1876,8/23/2021 22:43, hELLO, I also find it interesting that some birds can fly from alaska to north america without sleeping when they migrate.
945,1877,9/25/2021 21:29, Hi there!, Birds are very interesting because of a lot of facts.  I think it helps with their flight that their bones are hollow so not weighed down. 
181,1878,9/28/2021 12:17," Did you know that on april 18, 1930, the bbc decided there was no news worth reporting, so they broadcast piano music instead."," Yes, they are interesting. I did not know that hummingbirds steal spiderwebs to construct and repair their nests. I find that very interersting."
469,1879,9/25/2021 4:05," Really, wow! I wonder how many people had TV then?", I have watched them pull some to make them nearby.  The way they flit about is so beautiful to watch.  It is almost elegant like a dance. ..performing art!
735,1880,10/1/2021 3:08, Good question.  Freddie mercury used the same piano to record bohemian rhapsody as paul mccartney used to record hey jude," Yes, did you know that Jackie Chan manages a k-pop band. I did not know that but i think it's cool."
1019,1881,9/29/2021 10:48, cool! ever hears of Eurovision?," It seems that so many you wouldn't think to have other interests do.  Jackie in music, Bruce Lee in dancing.  A championship even!"
1154,1882,8/28/2021 7:53," No, what's that?", It seems to be in a kpop band you have to be tough because they go through bootcamps before being signed.
127,1883,9/24/2021 7:26,  Song Contest in england., Boot camps for bands.. Guess it takes a lot of stamina for the dancing and singing.  Kind of the same I would assume for figure skating.  Can you imagine the work to land a triple axel?
1259,1884,9/23/2021 9:17, Oh ok.  In 2006 a group of climbers reached the top of britain's highest mountain and found a piano, That is true. It looks hard. Did you know babies spontaneously dance when they hear music. They are cute.
1188,1885,10/12/2021 13:04, neat! apparently the competition away from its usual reliance on over-the-top spectacle.," Music is a wonderful thing, so much to come out of it.  Symbiotic relationship with dance and music. Tupac was able to do both- never would have thought ballet for him though."
1423,1886,9/13/2021 14:24, An aluminum grand piano was built for the lounge of the airship hindenburg. it weighed only 356 pounds.," Yes, that definitely does not fit his image. I was surprised that ballet dancers go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes a week. That is a lot."
1436,1887,9/23/2021 7:49, Wow! I did not know that! Portuguese broadcaster RTP had stripped the Eurovision stage of the walls of LED screens that have become ubiquitous backdrops in recent years.," The tip starts to break down and doesn't hold form.  Same with skates, have to keep them sharp or can't get the edge for spins and jumps. Would have to assume that Nagasu goes through a lot of skates for this reason."
142,1888,10/10/2021 9:13," When eddie van halen recorded the guitar solo for ""beat it"" he literally set the studio speakers on fire.", I like that she wanted to do the triple axel so bad that she dreamed she could . That shows heart for wanting to do something.
806,1889,9/20/2021 22:11, Oh my gosh! DO you like Jazz?," Especially when she had been passed over for the previous Olympics.  Rippon omitted his quad jump at the start, not as much heart I guess."
1109,1890,10/4/2021 3:16," No, not really.  You?", And she is part of the record books for being the first U.S. lady to land triple axel in olympic competition.

206,1892,9/29/2021 1:39," There is a programming language in which the programs are written in musical composition, and functional programs have jazz-like harmonies."," Yes, the doping scandal can be hard to come back from. It is amazing the amount of doping in sports today."
1337,1893,8/30/2021 7:16," I had no idea! Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression,"," You would think that rather than compromising, like the Olympic committee did, they would just start to ban them.  Isn't teaching them anything to allow certain numbers to still participate and medal."
1485,1894,9/29/2021 12:09, A harlem woman has held free jazz concerts at her apartment every sunday for 20 years. top performers occasionally stop by., That's true. Did you know Michael Jackson had a patent on his leaning dance move.
1163,1895,9/7/2021 9:45," Thats neat! New Orleans jazz began in the early 1910s, combining earlier brass-band marches, French quadrilles, biguine, ragtime and blues with collective polyphonic improvisation.", I didn't know that there was a device involved in it.  Wonder with his death if the patent transferred to someone?
862,1896,8/25/2021 22:30, Pakistan has a jazz orchestra that is currently topping the charts., Maybe it got passed down to his children.
144,1897,9/8/2021 3:59," Clint eastwood is a lifelong jazz enthusiast, pianist, and scored several films, including million dollar baby.", He certainly was talented.  Wonder if he did his own choreography?
598,1898,9/11/2021 0:44, Clint Eastwood movies are awesome, I think he did. He worked too hard and I think that is what caused his death. He had his whole family to take care of really.
1135,1899,9/13/2021 12:42, they are/ I like grand Torino especially. what is your fave?, So much control.  At least after he left Jackson 5 he had some freedom unlike the kids in K pop. Agencies controlling everything. Yikes!
1486,1900,8/23/2021 23:30, That's great one.  Unforgiven was awesome, That is true and to think K-pop had it's first group of women in the 60's is surprising. I thought k-pop was pretty new.
971,1901,9/2/2021 22:01, I'll have to look that one up! Jazz trumpeters grew goatees as it provided comfort when playing.," I was vaguely familiar with H.O.T. , Korean version of Backstreet Boys. Social networking and YouTube have launched a lot of the Korean Wave."

56,1903,8/26/2021 2:15, You too! Have a good day!, I wonder if because they are now going global with this music if you will start to see fusion music.  Would mix well with Latin beats.
1194,1904,9/21/2021 18:49, Thanks have a great day as well, I like that when North korea sank a south korean warship they blasted the k-pop song hit your heart on loud speakers.
1200,1905,9/11/2021 4:40, Matthew bellamy from the band muse holds the guinness world record for most guitars smashed on a tour.," I wonder if that song was by their own K pop girl band, moranbong,  or if they selected it from someone else?"
934,1906,9/18/2021 18:40," Hello, Do you enjoy Jazz?", Moranbong  band was  the most popular music group in the country. They must have a lot of fans.
1048,1907,10/7/2021 7:11," Hi! I do not have much experience with it, and I hope to rememdy that when we go to New Orleans later this year. I hear that is where it originated.", It is generally classified that way..K Pop.  Seems to have a more narrow sense of description and influence than back when they were around though.
1498,1908,10/13/2021 15:44," Yes, it did!! I have been there! You will love it! Lots of music and energy...It was developed from the blues and ragtime.", And they say with social media and tv  shows  k-pop are gaining a widespread global audience.
851,1909,9/27/2021 17:53, I guess Pakistan has a very good jazz orchestra.," To think that   different styles and genres of music can influence modern culture to such an extent as to become an ""idol"" like culture is mind boggling."
52,1910,9/15/2021 0:21," Really, I didn't know they like Jazz, that's interesting! Did you know Jazz trumpeters like to wear a goatee? It gives comfort when playing. Makes sense."," Yes, and I did not realize that when they are in bootcamp they are charged for everything. So when they make it famous they have to pay it all back."
526,1911,10/6/2021 9:54," I better not tell my son, or he will be trying to play my daughter's sax. Clint Eastwood is a jazz fan, and scored several films."," Just like any other job, pay for the training.  Unfortunately in this instance the control extends beyond all the way to love lives, behavior and diets.  Not for me thank you."
63,1912,9/30/2021 4:46," Yes, I heard he is a lifelong pianist! Very cool..In Harlem, in a woman's apartment for 20 years she holds Jazz concerts. Sometimes top performers stop by! ", It is like they control every part of their lives. That would  be very hard especially if they are young.
1024,1913,9/11/2021 19:21," I would love to live in that neighborhood. There is a computer program that writes in musical compositions, do you know the name of it?"," Maybe they will evolve, like the birds.  Sprout wings that give them flight.  Would think they would be more like an Ostrich or penguin in comparison..flightless."
737,1914,9/29/2021 11:54, No what? Did you know there is a piano at the top of Britain's highest mountain? I would like to see that!, I think so .
771,1915,10/3/2021 12:16, I would have loved to have been in the studio when Eddie Van Halen set the speakers on fire., Do you like to dance? 
566,1916,9/4/2021 9:32, I know pretty crazy!! Like when MJ caught his hair on fire! My goodness what's with the fire? I was interested to know about the computer program you mentioned?, I do sometimes even though I am terrible haha. How about you?
1066,1917,9/9/2021 2:31, He was recording a solo for Beat It., I'm terrible also. Hilarious!
1151,1918,8/26/2021 23:11," Yes, hmmm seems like MJ's songs can cause fires! lol I think it would be pretty interesting to be on Pink Floyd's houseboat called Astroria!  It's a recording studio."," We should have taken lessons from Bruce Lee when we had the chance, or were alive way back then lol."
1265,1919,9/16/2021 23:08, It's funny the sound that using coins as guitar picks lends to a song. Queens' guitarist does that.," Yeah, I heard he was a great dancer. Apparently Tupac was pretty good too. "
517,1920,8/25/2021 23:27," Yes, he likes the English sixpence.  Did you know Queen's guitarist has a PHD in astrophysics! Talented and smart.", Yea he portrayed the mouse king in a production of the nutcracker in high school for ballet!

230,1923,9/25/2021 9:41," I would think there would be. I thought the piano was an older instrument, it was invented in 1700's, not really that old.", Hilarious. I didn't know that babies did that. 
64,1924,10/11/2021 15:55," True, I love to hike, I can't imagine climbing to the top of Britain's highest mountain and finding a piano! I wonder how it holds up in the elements? Maybe it was just there for a time?", I wonder if they do it more listening to K-Pop? That's the Korean music craze going on now!
287,1925,9/30/2021 19:11," That is insane. I want to know more about those who hiked up there, carrying it. Why did they do it?"," Yeah, that is pretty funny. I'm not sure, MJ had a patent on dance moves though. "
1384,1926,9/30/2021 5:57," Yes, maybe it had a fantastic sound when recording? Do you play piano? I took some lesson when I was young and sent my daughter for lessons.", I remember seeing a video on that. It allowed him to achieve an extreme lean on his dance moves?
1456,1927,9/7/2021 19:34," I do not. Thanks for chatting with me, have a great day."," yeah, that is pretty cool. What do you think about birds? "
993,1928,10/10/2021 17:08, You too! Good chat!!, I think birds are crazy lol. It's cool their entire skeleton weights less than their feathers!

1367,1930,9/2/2021 10:17, Are you a fan of jazz by any chance?," I know they steal spiderwebs to construct and repair their nests. When I get a spider web on me, I freak out lol."
50,1931,9/11/2021 4:34, I like jazz but cant say I really know much about it., That is pretty scary. I wonder what noises birds in australia make? 
273,1932,10/2/2021 9:33, It's an interesting genre. Jazz trumpeters grew goatees because it provided comfort when playing. ," I think they've learned to make sounds like cameras, car alarms, and chainsaws. That would be weird to hear huh?"
280,1933,9/27/2021 12:07, that is interesting. Tupac Shakur studied jazz when he was in baltimore school of the arts," Yeah, that is pretty weird isn't it? I wonder if it is true. Well, nice chatting with you. "
1479,1934,9/18/2021 18:31, I would not have expected that at all. Things may have gone differently for him had he followed that passion. I know that the New Orleans style of jazz started in the 1910's. , I will have to check that out. Nice chatting with you as well!
1279,1935,9/1/2021 11:21, thats over a 100 years ago. Jazz has been seen as a major form of musical expression since the 1920's , Take it easy. 
1239,1936,8/31/2021 16:52, That is an old form of music especially compared to the most popular forms of music now. Pakistan has a jazz orchestra that is currently topping the charts., Do you know why baseball manager wear the uniforms like the players do? 
1029,1937,10/9/2021 17:09, I never new that . Did you know that louis armstrong ended the beatles three months on the billboard top 100, I do!  They wear it because they are technically able to play for their tams if the need arises!  Baseball is a pretty popular sport in Japan.  
845,1938,10/13/2021 9:07, WOW! I didn't think anything could stop The Beatles. No offence to Armstrong but I know a lot more people that still listen to The Beatles. , Yeah i hear they think it should be their pastime. I wonder if a manager has ever jumped into a game. 
666,1939,9/20/2021 13:16," This is a pretty interesting guitar fact,  A dial tone is in the key of f, serving as a pre-internet trick to tune your guitar", They can if need be.  There are some major baseballs fans out there!
891,1940,10/2/2021 5:23," WOW! That's clever. I enjoy guitar music. Queen's guitarist, Brian may, has a PHD in astrophysics.", Yeah unfortunately I do not have the patience for it. Kickball is called soccer baseball in Canada. 
363,1941,10/10/2021 2:22, he also built a guitar out of parts from an old fire place and his mothers knitting needles . super smart, That's a funny term in my opinion!  There was one person who found 3 million dollars worth of 1900s baseball cards in his grandfathers attic.  He  hit a gold mine!
844,1942,10/9/2021 2:53, Yes. Honestly all of Queen always struck me as a very intelligent group of men. I am also a big fan. ," Right, why can't stuff like that happen to me, lol. Up until 2005 a married couple was responsible for scheduling all 2430 major league games. "
108,1943,10/4/2021 21:55," I agree. did you know that the nokia ringtone  from a 1902 composition by spanish classical guitarist and composer francisco tarrega, called gran vals.", Dang that sounds like a busy life scheduling all that!  One thing I like from baseball is they get to wear hats.  Do you like hats?
359,1944,9/8/2021 14:27, I did not. It's been so long that I honestly can't remember what that sounded like. I wonder where the iPhone ring tone came from because I hear that everywhere lol. ," Love hats, all kinds my friend. How about you? "
1316,1945,10/8/2021 18:36, have you ever heard about a mute man from england that could only communicate to others with a piano," Yep I do also!  Fun little fact about in the Old West, the Cowboy hat was not the most popular.  The Bowler hat was, whichever that looks like!"
1298,1946,9/28/2021 6:55," I had not heard that but it's actually quite touching that he could find a way. Speaking of piano, Freddie mercury used the same piano to record bohemian rhapsody as paul mccartney used to record hey jude."," Yeah police wear distinct hats usually peaked caps or brimmed hats, like the mounties. "
1479,1947,9/9/2021 20:52, thats interesting , Yep their hats are noticeable!  Another fun fact I learned is a chefs funny hat they wear are called Toque!
1291,1948,9/23/2021 6:01, I thought so. I can't play piano but I enjoy the sound. If I had the room a player piano would be nice. , Yeah that is a fun fact i did not know that. Some hats were worn for ceremonial purposes such as the mortarboard.
1174,1949,9/15/2021 3:08, I like pianos I would like to learn how play one. they used to have steam piano and they were audible for miles, Ahh yes!  All this knowledge of hats!  Lol!  British politicians were mandated to wear a top hat if making a point of order in the house of commons until 1998!
1296,1950,10/8/2021 15:10, That must have been extremely loud up close. , Wow that good information. Do you know where tipping your hat originated from?  
903,1951,9/1/2021 9:17," Hi, how are doing over there on this fine evening?", Yep it just so happens to come from knights raising their face visors to show friendliness!
199,1952,10/4/2021 13:54, I am good thanks. How are you?, I think that's really cool! In 1908 a law was passed limiting the length of the hatpins out of fear that suffragettes would use them as weapons. 
978,1953,9/27/2021 21:42, I'm doing groovy over here. Are you a fan of tennis? , Wow sounded dangerous!  Did you know Dunce caps were worn to encourage foolish behavior?
439,1954,9/23/2021 4:30, Not so much. I heard that the longest tennis match in history went on for 11 hours. I definitely would not want to watch that., Well that's must be were the term originated. You know panda researcher wear panda suits to work. 
852,1955,9/26/2021 18:21, What if you had money on it though? That would make it worth it. ," I did not know that, but sounds fun!  Any who, was nice chatting with ya!"
1456,1956,9/28/2021 14:33, I think I would be more interested in the helicopter that dried the grass tennis courts for the 1969 US Open., You also have a great day!! In parting I tip my hat to you my friend.
1363,1957,10/10/2021 5:48, I guess hair dryers were not powerful enough then. A helicopter? That's a rich person's solution. , Hello
1116,1958,9/28/2021 17:38," And wait, grass tennis court? I wonder how well the ball bounced. Probaby grass cut really short but still."," Hello, how are you? Do you like baseball?"
135,1959,9/9/2021 14:00," Yeah, there are three kinds of courts. I guess grass has its effect on the ball. Do you use Google much?", I enjoy it. It is such a fun fast paced game to watch. Do you like it?
1196,1960,9/19/2021 10:22," Oh yeah, more than I shoud. I know I'm not the only one. In 2013 Google went down for five minutes and took 40 percent of web traffic with it.", I do enjoy baseball. There is nothing like going to a ball game. Did you know that the managers wear uniforms because they can technically can play if there is a need for it?
792,1961,9/21/2021 11:12," People are so dependent on the Internet. If civilization collapsed, the first thing they would do is search Google for a solution.", Really? I wouldn't have guessed that looking at most of the managers. They don't seem quite as in shape as most of the players on the team. 
932,1962,8/25/2021 13:31," Kind of related, but I have totally tried to Google things when my power is out. Haha."," Haha, I agree. It must be incase of injury or something. It's a strange rule. Did you hear the story about the man who found a bunch of 1900s baseball cards in his grandfathers attic? They were worth 3 million dollars!"
1012,1963,9/17/2021 17:25, We can't help it! Easy to get knowledge that provides answers to daily problems. Not there when I was a kid. , Oh man can you imagine going through stuff and all of sudden you come across a haul like that?! I would probably have a heart attack right then and there. 
475,1964,8/27/2021 4:36," Google's unofficial slogal is ""Don't be evil"" but I sometimes think it is evil. They calculate traffic by tracking how fast Android devices are moving on the road."," I couldn't even imagine, I would be so shocked. In japan baseball is very popular, and they are surprised to hear it;s status as america's national pastime?"
679,1965,9/7/2021 9:50," They are spying on us, even right now! But they do like dogs, which is pretty good right there.", I wonder why they were surprised. Baseball has always been such a popular game here in the states. Maybe because we are so synonomous with football?
178,1966,10/6/2021 14:07, And they did hire live goats to mow their lawns once. That is pretty kewl., What is your favorite team?
252,1967,9/19/2021 12:47, I would become a goat there if it got me stock options. , I guess if I had to pick I would go with the twins. They are a pretty decent team. I wonder if there was any twins cards in that guys 3 million dollar find.
696,1968,9/26/2021 6:10," Haha. So speaking of Google, I just Googled Borg vs. McEnroe. It is about one of the greatest tennis games ever played. Would you watch it?"," Maybe, that must of been so cool to find them."
150,1969,10/8/2021 15:05, I would watch. I don't think I'd bet on the outcome though. Isn't there some movie about them two?, I would be so excited to find something like that just sitting in my family's attic. Since they were from the 40's there had to be some amazing cards in there. 
880,1970,8/30/2021 21:26, Yes I think that is the title. Shia LaBeouf stars as McEnroe. I am not really too into sports movies., Do you collect anything? I like to collect hats.
439,1971,9/14/2021 6:22, It's probably mostly about personalities. McEnroe was intense. Borg was Swedish. That's enough personality for one film., Not really unless kids costumes count. I always thought hats were super neat. They have such a long and rich history. 
1257,1972,10/4/2021 22:02," Haha, hilarious. I will have to check it out!"," Yes they do, tipping your hat origin is from when a knight raises their visors."
41,1973,9/28/2021 3:24, Hello!  Are you a tennis fan or do you play?, That is a neat fact! I love that people always associate the cowboy hat with the old west but really it was the bowler that was the favorite of the time. 
732,1974,10/9/2021 0:58," No, my dad used to, though. It seems like it's too intense for me", That is true. The party hat originates from dunce caps... they were worn at parties to encourage a more foolish behavior!
559,1975,9/24/2021 3:17, I only tried playing in college to kill time.  I stunk up the courts I was so bad.  The longest tennis match in history went on for over 11 hours and was spread over 2 days.  Crazy., That is funny. I always thought of them as a punishment hat. Well it has been nice chatting with you have a good evening. 
882,1976,9/26/2021 22:16," Was that at one of the big competitions, like an open or Wimbledon?", You as well. Take care.
1134,1977,9/25/2021 8:08, I'm not sure.  They once had to use a helicopter to dry the grass courts for the 1969 US open.  Bet that dried it fast., Bye
4,1978,9/3/2021 8:13, That was the year after the first open when a black player won. But no black player has won since," Hi, how are you doing today?"
750,1979,10/13/2021 19:46, Wow.  I didn't know that.  Polo shirts were originally invented by a tennis player and were later adopted by polo players.  Interesting., Good. Do you watch baseball? Back in August the nationals traded Daniel Murphy and Matt Adams before a game
325,1980,8/24/2021 19:48, So maybe we should really be calling them tennis shirts? Just like sneakers are often called tennis shoes, Sometimes I follow baseball. Usually around playoffs. Did the Nationals make a mistake?
1292,1981,8/25/2021 2:45, lol  Good point!  They say that 5000 year old shoes perform better than modern shoes.  I question that... lol," I don't think so, they weren't doing too good in the standings plus they're stadium was half empty"
633,1982,9/25/2021 18:45, Same. How do people know? How many pairs have survived since then? And what constitutes better performance?," I guess it was time to make a change, maybe rebuild."
50,1983,10/11/2021 21:51, I have no idea.  I bet those would be some smelly shoes though!  They say putting a dry tea bag inside smelly shoes will absorb the unpleasant odor.  I'll have to try that to try that on my smelly stinky shoes. Lol lol," Yea they weren't doing too good, they were in third place in their division behind the Phillies"
1016,1984,9/9/2021 5:53," Oh wow, I never knew that. I actually have a huge problem with that, so that will help. Surprised I didn't learn that when I googled solutions to that problem (which I've done like 100 times)"," I think it's tough to the lineup just right. Too many variables, and the team needs to gel as well."
455,1985,10/13/2021 18:40, I'm a big googler myself.  A single google search requires more computing power than it took to send astronauts to the moon. Crazy how far technology has come since then.," Yea and the fans weren't too happy with trading Daniel Murphy, guess he was a fan favorite"
808,1986,9/7/2021 23:52," I can't even begin to understand how that makes sense. Then again, I guess computing was done a lot by people by hand back in the 60's", Did he sell enough tickets though? Probably most fans would want a winning team. 
1180,1987,9/21/2021 18:10, When google went down for 5 minutes in 2013 it took 40 percent of the web traffic with it.  I don't remember that.," Probably, they can always let their baseball manager play as they are technically allowed to play"
212,1988,8/25/2021 22:22," I don't remember that either, but it makes sense. Did you know that Google as a company officially prefers dogs over cats?!"," That's a funny rule, isn't it. It must be a holdover from early days when a player also served as manager."
738,1989,9/8/2021 18:36, I didn't know that.  I know at one time they used hundreds of live goats to mow the lawns around their headquarters.  They really like their animals.," Yea, I remember back in the 1970s when Pete Rose was a manager he would sometimes play in the games too"
268,1990,9/18/2021 19:44," Yeah! I guess it wasn't too cost effective to do that with the goats, otherwise they'd keep doing it. Pretty energy efficient, though", Pete really was a competitive guy. He also bet against his team sometimes though. 
914,1991,9/3/2021 17:33, I agree!  Good was founded in 1998.  I could have sworn I remember using it before then., Yea that's not good. I have old Pete Rose baseball cards but they're not worth 3 million like the cards a man found in his grandfather's attic

Like I remember her writing it on the board and another teacher telling us it was an intentional misspelling of the number googol," That guy must not have been able to believe his luck. I wonder what he did with the cards. I would have sold half and kept half. Money now, plus a long-term investment."
580,1993,10/13/2021 18:01, Interesting!  I have to get going.  It was nice chatting with you!  Have a good night!, I'd take a trip to Japan where baseball is also very popular
1279,1994,9/1/2021 3:15," Hello, do you follow tennis?"," The baseball there is just not as good as in the US. Still, it's a difference experience at the stadium. It's an interesting lesson in cultural difference."
976,1995,10/2/2021 7:37, Not really. I just know each player uses a strung racket and they hit a hollow ball.," I'd like to visit England too, it's funny how until 1998 their politicians had to wear a top hat in the house of commons"
61,1996,8/26/2021 19:11, Did you know Polo shirts were originally invented for tennis?, I guess rules get held over for the sake of tradition. The old guard wants politicians in top hats and managers in player uniforms.
403,1997,9/17/2021 0:42," I did know. I know Lacoste shirts had the crocodile and it was a symbol for Rene ""the crocodile"" lacoste who was a famous player.", And Johnny Depp wears his Jack Sparrow costume to make visits to hospitals
57,1998,9/1/2021 5:38, Yep. A black man won the first US open tennis title back in 1968 and no black man has won it since., He really does his best for the kids. I like that he's willing to make some kid's day better. 
718,1999,9/11/2021 15:42, Wow! Over 50 years and still holding the record! I think the next year in 1969 they used a helicopter to dry the grass tennis courts for the US open.," He is a good person. Well I got to go, nice talking with you"
